SCCP (Skinny Client Control Protocol) for Asterisk.
  -- By Zozo.

INSTALL
-------

To install, edit Makefile, and change the ASTERISK_SOURCE= line to point to
the root of your asterisk source.  You may need to change some of the other
options, if you don't know how or why, you probably don't need to :)

then:

  make
  make install

You'll need to point your cisco phone (in call manager mode) to a tftp server,
which contains the conf/XMLDefault.cnf.xml file in this source in the root.

Change <processNodeName> to the IP of your asterisk server.

You can send calls to *lines* using SCCP/linename.

In your extensions.conf, you can also use the SetCalledParty application if you wish:

exten => 1001,1,SetCalledParty("Zozo" <1001>)
exten => 1001,2,Dial(SCCP/theo)
exten => 1001,3,Hangup()

This will set the display on the calling phone to indicate you are calling "Zozo", on ext 1001,
providing it is an SCCP device.
