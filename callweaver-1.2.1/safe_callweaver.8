.SH NAME
.B safe_callweaver
\(em A wrapper to run the callweaver executable in a loop
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP 
.B safe_callweaver
.I [ callweaver_params ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B safe_callweaver 
is a script that runs callweaver in a loop, which can be useful if you 
fear callweaver may crash.

The script does not run in the background like a standard service. Rather, 
it runs in its own linux virtual console (9, by default).
It also uses the option '-c' of callweaver(8) to avoid detaching callweaver 
from that terminal.

safe_callweaver also runs callweaver with unlimited core file size, and thus 
callweaver will dump core in case of a crash.

To get a "picture" of console 9, from another terminal (e.g: from a 
remote shell session) you can use:

  screendump 9

The init script of the Debian package should be able to run safe_callweaver 
as the callweaver service, if so configured. See coments in 
/etc/default/callweaver

.SH FILES
.B /tmp
.RS
safe_callweaver runs in that directory, rather than in / as usual.
.RE

.B /tmp/core
.RS
If core files were generated there, they may be 
.RE

.SH BUGS
While showing the output on a console is useful, using screen(1) as 
the terminal may be better.

The script does not read configuration from standard location under /etc

It uses fixed locations under /tmp , and thus may be exposed to a 
symlink attacks.
