This is a preliminary version of icd with jabber support.
Needs one hell of a cleanup we are doing right now.
Events need to be made a lot cleaner and less of them :)
Jabber is stable but will be probably replaced by some sort of gernral res for callweaver
This work was mostly sponsored by Halo Kwadrat Sp. z o.o.
and partly by Sangoma Inc.
Many many thanks to Bruce Callendish, Tim Clark and Anthony Minesalle for the initial icd version
which we are now extending and adopting for callweaver.org
