************************************************************
 How to build CallWeaver.org on NetBSD
************************************************************

(Initial note: the same instructions applies to SpanDSP)

To configure, please use something like the following:

CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -gstabs" \
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib" \
\
./configure \
    **INSERT HERE YOUR CONFIGURE OPTIONS** \
    --enable-internal_libedit


Please note that -gstabs is only needed if you want to debug.
It's, anyway, always a good flag to add.

------------------------------------------------------------

After configuring what you need, you'll need to compile.
Don't use make.
Use gmake or things will not work.

#gmake
#gmake install 

and enjoy !!

************************************************************

Additional notice:
NetBSD has posix timers with 10ms resolution.
If you know how to improve, please drop a note on the ML so that
we can add some more informations.

Attitional notice #2:
if you experience something like:
 callweaver: Error detected by libpthread: Invalid condition variable.
and a following crash, ee are interested in a backtrace of 
the fault in order to dig around to find the cause.

To solve the problem (temporarily), try to set the env 
variable PTHREAD_DIAGASSERT=AE and run callweaver.
