This module can be used to pull realtime and static callweaver configuration from a cgi or a 
static webpage using curl. 
This application should be useful for callweaver implementations, large and small,
for provisioning or providing a load balanced LCR engine using a cluster of web servers.

There are several ways you can use this module. 

As an application:

    URLFetch()
    Fetch Data from a URL
    "load a url that returns ast_config and set according chanvars"

This applications fetches a hash from the url supplied. You call the app and it makes chan vars 
based on the return data formatted like callweaver config, but beginnig with ;OK; in the 
section [realtime]

;OK;
[realtime]
a => b
c => d
foo => bar

or as a realtime config plugin:

extconfig.conf:

; trailing / means append desired filename /
queues.conf => curl,http://my.box.com/
; not trailing / means treat it as a cgi ?_file=
curl.conf => curl,http://my.box.com/test_res_config.cgi
whatever => curl,http://my.box.com/test_res_config.cgi

The return from the url should look like the example above, please note, it must begin with ;OK;
The rest of the contents should match the format of regular callweaver config files.
On realtime, this should begin with [realtime].
