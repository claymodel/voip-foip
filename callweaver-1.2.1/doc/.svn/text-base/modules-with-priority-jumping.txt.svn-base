The following modules use priority jumping. This should be changed to setting
variables instead and always returning zero

These are separated into two groups. Will fix and Won't fix. Since some of these
are in modules or apps that are depricated, or part of the 1.2 high priority
modules, we won't fix them.

WON'T FIX
  apps/icd/icd_bridge.c
  apps/app_osplookup.c
  apps/app_valetparking.c
  	These modules are not part of the default build/configure, and are not
	officially supported in in 1.2, so no change will be made to fix
	priority jumping.
