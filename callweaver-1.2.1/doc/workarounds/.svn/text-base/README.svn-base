We have collected a set of patches here for hacky workarounds that may break
standards, but still can come in handy. Below is a list of the patches and brief
documentation.


sip-silencesupp.patch
	This patch, discussed in http://bugs.digium.com/view.php?id=6669 and
	http://callweaver.org/ticket/58 enables turning off silence suppression
	SIP headers, a=silenceSupp:off for client SIP stacks that don't support
	this set to off. To use this, add silencesupp=hide for the peer in
	sip.conf.
