;
; network_role = private
;		(user | private | local | transit | international)
;	The role of the interface in the ISDN network. Normally you would use
;	"private" to indicate a private branch. If you ever want to be seen as
;	the public operator you should use "local". "transit" and
;	"international" are mostly unused.
;	Context: global, interface
;
; type_of_number = unknown
;		(unknown | international | national | network_specific |
;		subscriber | abbreviated)
; 	Type of number used for called numbers (outbound calls)
;	Context: global, interface
;
; local_type_of_number = unknown
;		(unknown | international | national | network_specific |
;		subscriber | abbreviated)
; 	Type of number used for caller id. Some network require you to use a
;	specific type of network to correctly accept the caller_id.
;	Context: global, interface
;
; overlap_sending = Yes
;	Enables/disables overlap dialing. Disabiling overlap dialing means
;	that the called party number in the SETUP message is considered
;	complete. If existant it will be connected, otherwise the call will
;	be rejected. Note that "sending" means that the user is sending digits.
;	Context: global, interface
;
; overlap_receiving = No
;	Enables/disables overlap receiving on the interface. Overlap receiving
;	is used to implement DID thru PBXs.
;	Context: global, interface
;
; context =
;	Context in which to look for destination in inbound calls
;	Context: global, interface
;
; default_inbound_caller_id =
;	Caller ID to be used when the peer (usually the phones when we are
;	acting as the network).
;	Context: global, interface
;
; force_inbond_caller_id =
;	Always use this caller party number with inbound calls. Mostly used
;	in NT role with phones attached.
;
; national_prefix =
;	Prefix to prepend when transforming numbers of type "national"
;	Context: global, interface
;
; international_prefix =
;	Prefix to prepend when transforming numbers of type "international"
;	Context: global, interface
;
; autorelease_dlc =
;	Release the DLC after the specified timeout (in seconds).
;	'0' disabled the autorelease mechanism.
;	Context: global, interface
;
; T301 = T322
;	Configure Layer3/CCB timers. For a description of the timers meaning
;	refer to ETS 300 102 Table 9.1 and successive modifications.
;	Avoid to modify them if you don't know what you're doing.
