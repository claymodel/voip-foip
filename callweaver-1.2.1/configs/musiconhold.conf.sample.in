;
; Music on Hold -- Sample Configuration
;

;
; File-based (native) music on hold
;
; This plays files directly from the specified directory, no external
; processes are required. Files are played in normal sorting order
; (same as a sorted directory listing), and no volume or other
; sound adjustments are available. If the file is available in
; the same format as the channel's codec, then it will be played
; without transcoding (same as Playback would do in the dialplan).
; Files can be present in as many formats as you wish, and the
; 'best' format will be chosen at playback time.
;
; NOTE:
; If you are not using "autoload" in modules.conf, then you
; must ensure that the format modules for any formats you wish
; to use are loaded _before_ res_musiconhold. If you do not do
; this, res_musiconhold will skip the files it is not able to
; understand when it loads.

; The following examples *require* mpg123 v0.59r and *not* the mpg321
; that is more commonly available.  However, mpg123 has *serious*
; security flaws so we *do not* recommend that you use these MOH
; classes.  These examples are kept here only for backwards
; compatibility.  We recommend that you convert your MP3s to file
; types that are supported by the native file MOH above.  See the
; CallWeaver.org Wiki for tips on how to convert your sound files.
