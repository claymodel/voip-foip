NConference is a channel independent conference 

It is distributed under GPL V2.

It was written by Massimo "CtRiX" Cetra -

Inspiration was taken from app_conference and some (small)
parts of the code were re-used.

exten => 1234,n,Set(NCONF_OUTBOUND_CID_NAME=Nconf)
exten => 1234,n,Set(NCONF_OUTBOUND_CID_NUM=9999)
; Here we are ! :-)
