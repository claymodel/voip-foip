/*******************************
 * The use of the jitterbuffer *
 *******************************
 * Always create a new jitterbuffer with jb_new().
 * Always destroy a jitterbuffer with jb_destroy().
 *
 * There is no lock(mutex) mechanism, that your responsibility.
 * The reason for this is that different environments require
 * different ways of implementing a lock.
 *
 * The following functions require a lock on the jitterbuffer:
 * jb_reset(), jb_reset_all(), jb_destroy(), jb_set_settings(),
 * jb_get_info(), jb_get_settings(), jb_has_frames(), jb_put(),
 * jb_get()
 *
 * The following functions do NOT require a lock on the jitterbuffer:
 * jb_new(), jb_guess_mos()
 *
 * Since control packets have a higher priority above any other packet
 * a call may already be ended while there is audio left to play. We
 * advice that you poll the jitterbuffer if there are frames left.
 *
 * If the audiopath is oneway (eg. voicemailbox) and the latency doesn't
 * matter, we advice to set a minimum jitterbuffer size. Then there is
 * less loss and the quality is better.
