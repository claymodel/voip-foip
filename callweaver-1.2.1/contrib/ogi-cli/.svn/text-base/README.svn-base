ogi-cli, @2007 by Antonio Gallo (AGX)  - www.badpenguin.org

There is an ongoing discussion about removing the CLI from inside the main 
program because it give so some problems.

So to give an alternative ready as soon as possible i'm going to deliver some
utility first using Perl and the evaluating to make ti a compiled version for 
perfomance.

The utility will be:
- rcallweaver.pl	compatible with rcallweaver and callweaver -r ;
- eventwatcher.pl	connect and pretty printing of what is going on into 
			the PBX; no user input, just for watching;
- managergui.pl		combination of the two, maybe splitting the screen
			into more windows using newt or curses for managing
			different views of what is going on.

Requirements:
- managergui.pl		required libnewt-perl

Actual state:
- rcallweaver.pl	it works, check the TODO inside the source code for
			missing features;
- eventwatcher.pl	it print the events, need to finish it;
- managergui.pl		not started yet, need to finish the two before;
- rcallweaver		porintg of rcallweaver in C since this is a very small
			program should not be difficult to convert from perl.
