These are all modules for interfacing with the CallWeaver.org open source pbx
system.

The main site for these files is http://callweaver.org.gnuinter.net, or soon
to be found at a CPAN mirror near you.

There is a mailing list setup to discuss callweaver.org-perl related topics,
you can subscribe by sending an empty email to 
callweaver.org-perl-subscribe@lists.gnuinter.net

Some documentation is in the the perl modules, use perldoc to read it
(example: perldoc CallWeaver::OGI)

To install these modules just do:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make all
	make install
