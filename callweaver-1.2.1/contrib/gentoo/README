Intro
-----

This for people running Gentoo/portage and who wants to try the current trunk
of CallWeaver. There are two versions, daily bootstrapped and svn.

Digests are already made so they should match. Just drop the 2 subdirs in your $PORTDIR_OVERLAY and you are all set.

Requirements
------------

- spandsp spandsp-0.0.4_pre1.ebuild (in media-libs)
- you need to know how to put files in $PORTDIR_OVERLAY and $DISTDIR (see 
  Gentoo wiki for how to do that)
- activate $PORTDIR_OVERLAY in your make.conf

Pre-flight check
----------------

- put the spandsp ebuild in $PORTDIR_OVERLAY/media-libs/spandsp
- put net-misc in your $PORTDIR_OVERLAY
- cd $PORTDIR_OVERLAY/media-libs/spandsp
- cd $PORTDIR_OVERLAY/net-misc/callweaver

Installation
------------
- emerge -pv callweaver
- set the USE flags you want (EXPERIMENTAL!!!)
- emerge callweaver

You will find more information about how to run/configure CallWeaver.org on
http://www.CallWeaver.org/

A Gentoo HOWTO is coming soon.

Regards,
heart
