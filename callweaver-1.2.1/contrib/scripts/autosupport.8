.B autosupport

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B autoasupport
is a script that is normally run by a user contacting Digium's support 
to automate gathering support information.

It will probe the system for some configuration and run-time information, 
and will also prompt the user for some optional access information (IP 
address, login and password).

The information is written to /root/callweaversupportinfo which the user is expected 
to attach to a support ticket to trusted sources.

The script must be run as root as it reads CallWeaver's configuration and 
the disk information using hdparm(8).
