soon and then 1.2.0. So we're not accepting any more features since its freezed.

I'm collecting here usefull patches for new features that will going to be in 1.2.1
don't forget that "trunk" is the new 2.0 but will require some times before it
is out since we're rewriting the whole "core" of the system.

So it make senses to use those patches:

- app_pickup2:	porting of Pickup2, PickDown2, Steal2; enahnced version of Pickup
		that allow to pickup multiple extensions using a channell instead
		of an extension

- cdr_mysql_extra:	add a new value in manager_mysql.conf called "extrafields="
			that add those fields to the mysql insert query when the
			PBX post a CDR.

NOTE: patch has been generated using "svn diff" to apply the patch be sure to be
in source root directory and to use "patch -p0 < contrib/..../filename.patch"
