It's easy to setup an email to fax gateway with these simple steps:

1. Setup the HylaFAX software as usual.

2. If your system uses sendmail to deliver mail, then follow the
   instructions in mailfax.sh-sendmail.

3. If your system uses smail (e.g. Linux users), then follow the
   instructions in mailfax.sh-smail.

4. If your system uses qmail to deliver mail, then follow the
   instructions in mailfax.sh-qmail.

5. If your system uses Postfix to deliver mail, then follow the
   instructions in mailfax.sh-postfix.

6. Restart your mail software, refreeze your configuration or
   whatever is necessary to cause the configuration changes to be
   seen by the system.

Voila!  Now mail to user@dest.fax will get formatted and submitted as a
facsimile job to "user" at the specified "dest".  By writing a more
involved mailfax script you can add things like different resolutions
by parsing the "user" string.  For example, an X.400-style scheme might
use:

    user/R=low/N=done@host.fax

where "R=low" specifies a low res facsimile and "N=done" requests
notification when the job is done.  If you want symbolic destinations,
then you can provide a host to phone number mapping facility.

NOTE: The normal access control mechansims on submitting a facsimile
for transmission are enforced--you may need to use them if you create
an email to fax gateway on your machine!

Dirk Husemann's more elaborate scheme is included in the contributed
software; check out ../contrib/dirk.

There is also the "Remote Printing Experiment" being conducted by folks
on the Internet.  This provides a distributed fax delivery service that
uses email to relay facsimile to a local site for delivery.  For info
about that stuff send mail to tpc-faq@town.hall.org.
