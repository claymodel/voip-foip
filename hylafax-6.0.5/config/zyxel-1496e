# Configuration for a ZyXEL U1496.  Firmware revisions from
# 5.02 on should work, though rev 6.01 works much better. 
# Actually, the preferred use is to get firwmare rev 6.13 or
# 6.14 and configure the modem to use Class 2.0; this file
# is kept around for folks with old firmware.
#
# This configuration file sets up the ZyXEL to run at 38.4 for
# both sending and receiving.  RTS/CTS flow control is used on
# the tty port--you probably shouldn't use XON/XOFF.  Note that
# on an SGI system the getty speed is the following non-standard
# gettydefs entry:
#
# dx_38400# B38400 # B38400 SANE TAB3 HUPCL #\r\n\n$HOSTNAME login: #dx_38400

# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2		# use class 2 interface
ModemRate:		19200
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemNoFlowCmd:		AT&H0		# disable flow control
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&H3		# hardware flow control
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&H4		# software flow control
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D2		# DTR off causes modem to hang up
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# DCD tracks carrier
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=1	# enable in current class
#
ModemSendFillOrder:	LSB2MSB		# as expected
ModemRecvFillOrder:	MSB2LSB		# opposite of what makes sense
Class2RecvDataTrigger:	"\022"		# a la 2388-B
#
# Additional reset commands:
#
# &B1	  DTE-DCE rate is fixed at DTE setting
# &N0	  Auto-negotiate highest possible DCE-DCE link rate
# &S0	  DSR always on
# *F0	  Deny remote configuration
# S18=2	  Receive at 38400 (removed from default)
# S38.3=1 DCD on/off sequence follows UNIX standard; also
#	  fix receiving baud rate at S18 value
# S39=0	  (avoid Class 2 compatibility hacks)

# We normally append the "@" symbol to the dial string so that
# the modem will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect
# and return result codes that distinguish between no carrier
# and no answer.  This makes it possible to avoid problems with
# repeatedly dialing a number that doesn't have a fax machine
# (kudos to Stuart Lynne for this trick.)
#
# Unfortunately, ZyXEL's don't seem to detect a busy signal when
# the @ symbol is used to terminate the dialing string.  Instead
# calls to a busy line come back with a NO CARRIER status which
# causes us to toss the job.  Consequently we fall back to the
# normal method and raise the number of retries on a no carrier
# status.  ZyXEL claims that this behaviour is not a bug, but 
# rather that we are requesting ``an enhancement'' (never mind
# that their manual says that it should work).
#
ModemDialCmd:		ATDT%s		# no '@' 'cuz then busy not recognized

# Rev 6.1x firmware have a bug in the ECM support so

# comment out the following line.
