# Configuration for using the Class 2.0 command interface with
# a Elsa MicroLink 56k basic

# EDIT THIS CONFIGURATION TO REFLECT YOUR SETUP
#
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:              Class2.0        # use this to supply a hint
ModemRate:              115200          # max rate for DCE-DTE communication
ModemFlowControl:       rtscts          # XON/XOFF flow control assumed
ModemSetupDTRCmd:       AT&D2           # setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:       AT&C1           # setup so DCD reflects carrier (or not)
#
# We can append the "@" symbol to the dial string so that
# the modem will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect
# and return result codes that distinguish between no carrier
# and no answer.  This makes it possible to avoid problems with
# repeatedly dialing a number that doesn't have a fax machine
# (kudos to Stuart Lynne for this trick.)
#
# NB: If you need to prefix phone numbers to get through a PBX,
#     put it in the ModemDialCmd; e.g. "DT9%s@".
