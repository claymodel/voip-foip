# Configuration for using the Class 1 command interface with
# a Digicom Systems, Inc (DSI) Scout+ modem.  Firmware version
# 2A19/2931 (ati1?) or newer.
#
# XON/XOFF flow control must be used in firmware revisions before
# 3507/3506 because the modem does not honor RTS/CTS during page
# transfers.  Later revisions permit the configuration of RTS/CTS
# flow control through a new (undocumented) register, S24:
#
# Value	Meaning
#   0	use XON/XOFF in fax mode
#   1	use RTS/CTS in fax mode
#   2	use what is specified by *F in fax mode
#
# Note also that the value of S24 is not permanent.  It is reset
# after each disconnect.  On power on S24 is 0.  S24 is unchanged
# by the &F command.
