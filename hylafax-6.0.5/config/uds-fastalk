#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#

#
# We can append the "@" symbol to the dial string so that
# the modem will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect
# and return result codes that distinguish between no carrier
# and no answer.  This makes it possible to avoid problems with
# repeatedly dialing a number that doesn't have a fax machine
# (kudos to Stuart Lynne for this trick.)
#
# NB: If you need to prefix phone numbers to get through a PBX,
#     put it in the ModemDialCmd; e.g. "DT9%s@".
#
ModemDialCmd:		ATDT%s		# T for tone dialing
#
# I had better results when I wasn't doing receive quality checking
# turn these back on if you want - but don't blame me for results !!
