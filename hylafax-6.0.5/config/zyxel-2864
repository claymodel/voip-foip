# Configuration for a ZyXEL 2864, 2864I, or Omni 288S in Class 2.0.
#
# This configuration file can set up the ZyXEL to run at 38.4 for
# both sending and receiving.  RTS/CTS flow control is used on
# the tty port--you probably shouldn't use XON/XOFF.  Note that
# on an SGI system the getty speed is the following non-standard
# gettydefs entry:
#
# dx_38400# B38400 # B38400 SANE TAB3 HUPCL #\r\n\n$HOSTNAME login: #dx_38400
