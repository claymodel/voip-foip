# Configuration for an AT&T Paradyne DataPort w/ Class 2.0 firmware.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2.0: AT?T*Paradyne*-*
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2.0	# use class 2.0 interface
ModemRate:		19200
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&R0\D1\Q3	# use RTS/CTS and enable RS232 handling
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&R1\D0\Q1	# use RTS/CTS and enable RS232 handling
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D2		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD follows carrier
#
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=1	# enable in current class
#
# The modem returns "OK" when there is a timeout before carrier is
# established.  This is treated as "NO CARRIER" by faxd.  Thus we
# need to up the NoCarrierRetrys parameter to avoid having the server
# reject jobs prematurely.
#
NoCarrierRetrys:	3		# retry 3 times on no carrier
#
PagerSetupCmds:		ATS41=10%B300	# use V.21 at 300 bps
