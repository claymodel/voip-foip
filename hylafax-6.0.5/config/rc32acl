# Configuration for a Rockwell RC32ACL-based Class 2 modem.
#    Boca M1440E		firmware V1.000
#    SupraFAX v.32bis		firmware V1.000
# (and others)
#
# This configuration file sets up the modem to run at 38.4 for
# sending and for receiving.  RTS/CTS is used for flow control
# which also works for data connections.  Adaptive answer support
# is reliable, but to use it you must also enable ModemWaitForConnect
# to force the server to skip intermediate status messages and
# wait for the "CONNECT" message.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: ROCKWELL-RC32ACL*-*
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
