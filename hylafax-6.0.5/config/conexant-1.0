# Configuration for a Rockwell/Conexant K56 Class 1.0 modem using
# the RCV56DPF and similar chipsets.  These chipsets are generally
# flash- upgradable and appear on ISA as well as PCI.  They
# support "Class 1.0" which means that they have "adaptive receive"
# (AT+FAR=1), but not V.34.

#
ModemType:		Class1.0	# use this to supply a hint
ModemRate:		19200		# rate for DCE-DTE communication
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
# With the RocketModem IV (and possibly III) you may need to use a much
# higher ModemRate than 19200 because, apparently, it suffers from potential
# buffer underrun problems.  Fortunately, it doesn't have buffer overflow
# issues, and so using 115200 should work (both rtscts and xonxoff test good).
#
ModemNoFlowCmd:		AT&K0		# setup no flow control
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&K3		# setup hardware flow control
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&K4		# setup software flow control
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D2		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD reflects carrier (or not)
#
Class1AdaptRecvCmd:	AT+FAR=1	# reports carrier detection mismatches
