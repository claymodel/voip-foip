# Configuration for a Rockwell V.32AC Class 2 modem
# (RC144AC, RC96AC or using RC144DP).
#    Boca M1440E		firmware V1.270 or newer
#    Dallas Fax			(throw it away!)
#    Hayes Optima 24+Fax96	firmware TR00-J260-001 XXX or newer
#    SupraFAX v.32bis		firmware V1.200-C or newer
#    Twincom 144/DF		firmware rev V1.200 or newer
#    Dynalink 1414VE		firmware rev ???
# (and others)
#
# This configuration file sets up the modem to run at 38.4 with
# RTS/CTS flow control used by default.  XON/XOFF is automatically
# enabled for fax recv.  Beware of modems that also lock sending
# to 19.2; add ModemSendBeginCmd: "<19200>" if this is required.
# Also beware that the adaptive-answer facility, when supported,
# is often unreliable.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: *-V.32AC-*

# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
