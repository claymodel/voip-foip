# Configuration for a Rockwell-based modem not otherwise handled by
# another prototype configuration file.  This file assumes the modem
# is compatible with the Rc144AC, RC96AC or RC144DP.
#
# This configuration file sets up the modem to run at 38.4 with
# RTS/CTS flow control used by default.  XON/XOFF is automatically
# enabled for fax recv.  Beware of modems that also lock sending
# to 19.2; add ModemSendBeginCmd: "<19200>" if this is required.
# Also beware that the adaptive-answer facility, when supported,
# is often unreliable.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: ROCKWELL*-*
