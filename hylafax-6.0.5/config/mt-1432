# Configuration for a Multi-Tech MT1432, MT224BA, and MT1932ZDX modems.
#
# MT1432	firmware rev 0307 I or newer
# MT132BG	rev 0109A
# MT1932ZDX	rev 0109H
# MT2834ZDX	rev 0316A or newer
# MT2834ZDXb	rev 0317G or newer
#
# Note that MT1432 modems come in several varieties:
#
# MT1432BA	uses Rockwell data pump
# MT1432BA/A	uses AT&T data pump
# MT1432BG	MT1432BA tweaked for German FCC
# MT1432MK	(for UK?)
#
# The modem has been tried with both XON/XOFF and RTS/CTS flow
# control; this configuration is for hardware flow control.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: Multi-Tech*-*
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2		# use class 2 interface
ModemRate:		38400		# lock rate for DCE-DTE communication
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&E4		# hardware flow control
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&E5		# software flow control
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D3		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD reflects carrier (or not)
# The MT2834ZDX (and other newer models) may be more robust with this.
#ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C4		# setup so DCD resets modem on
#					# carrier drop
#
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=1	# enable adaptive-answer in class 2
#
# NB: some models get confused by @ in ModemDialCmd
# NB: the @ causes some multifunction fax units to not go into fax mode.
#
ModemDialCmd:		ATDT%s		# T for tone dialing
#
Class2RecvDataTrigger:	"\022"		# character sent to modem to start recv
#
# The MT2834ZDX (and other newer models) can take advantage of these.
#Class2APQueryCmd:	AT		# AT+FAP=? not supported on this modem
#Class2NFLOCmd:		AT+FLO=0	# Class 2: no flow control
#Class2SFLOCmd:		AT+FLO=1	# Class 2: software flow control
#Class2HFLOCmd:		AT+FLO=2	# Class 2: hardware flow control
#Class2XmitWaitForXON:	no
