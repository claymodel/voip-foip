#
# Configuration for using the Class 2 command interface with
# an AT&T DataPort 14.4 modem.  Firmware version 166 (ati1)
# or newer.
#
# Hardware flow control is used by default.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: AT?T*Paradyne*-*
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2		# use class 2 interface
ModemRate:		19200		# set rate for DCE-DTE communication
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&R0\D1\Q3	# use RTS/CTS and enable RS232 handling
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&R1\D0\Q1	# use RTS/CTS and enable RS232 handling
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D2		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD follows carrier
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=1	# enable adaptive-answer in Class 2
#
ModemRecvFillOrder:	MSB2LSB		# bit order of received facsimile
ModemSendFillOrder:	LSB2MSB		# bit order modem expects for transmit
#
# The modem returns "OK" when there is a timeout before carrier is
# established.  This is treated as "NO CARRIER" by faxd.  Thus we
# need to up the NoCarrierRetrys parameter to avoid having the server
# reject jobs prematurely.
#
NoCarrierRetrys:	3		# retry 3 times on no carrier
#
# Rev C01.66.10 firmware gives a bogus result string for
# +FDCC=? query so we override it here.  Syntax is:
#
#	(vr),(br),(wd),(ln),(df),(ec),(bf),(st)
# where,
#	vr	vertical resolution
#	br	bit rate
#	wd	page width
#	ln	page length
#	df	data compression
#	ec	error correction
#	bf	binary file transfer
#	st	scan time/line
#
# Note that if your modem does not support V.17 then you'll need
# to restrict the values of br to (0-3) intead of (0-5).
#
Class2DCCQueryCmd:	"!(0,1),(0-5),(0-4),(0-2),(0),(0),(0),(0-7)"
#
# There's no suport for HDLC frame tracing; silence the avoid
# error message so naive folks don't ask if it's a problem.
#
Class2BugCmd:		AT+FBUG=0
#
# Enable copy quality checking with some "average" parameters:
#
#     +FBADMUL=20	<20% bad lines for OK quality
#     +FBADLIN=10	no more than 10 consecutive bad line on a page
#
# Note that default values set by the rev 1.76 firmware are 20 and 0.
#
Class2CQCmd:		AT+FCQ=1;+FBADMUL=20;+FBADLIN=10
#
PagerSetupCmds:		ATS41=10%B300	# use V.21 at 300 bps
