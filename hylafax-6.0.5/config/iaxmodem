# The modem is taken off-hook during initialization, and then
# placed back on-hook when done to prevent glare.

# Older iaxmodem versions didn't support V.17 very well.  It can be
# disabled in this fashion:

#Class1RMQueryCmd:	"!24,48,72,96"	# V.17 fast-train recv doesn't work well
#Class1TMQueryCmd:	"!24,48,72,96"	# V.17 fast-train recv doesn't work well
