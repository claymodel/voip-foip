# Configuration for a Rockwell AC/K56-based Class 2 modem.
# based upon work of Mark J. Bailey, Jonathan Mau and Glenn Burkhardt.
#    Multitech MT5600ZDX
#    Diamond Multimedia SupraExpress 56e PRO
#    Zoom Telephonics 56Kx
# (and others)
#
# This configuration file sets up the modem to run at 38.4 for
# sending and for receiving.  XON/XOFF is used for flow control
# which also works for data connections.  Adaptive answer support
# is reliable, but to use it you must also enable ModemWaitForConnect
# to force the server to skip intermediate status messages and
# wait for the "CONNECT" message.
