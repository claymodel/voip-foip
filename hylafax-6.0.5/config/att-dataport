# Configuration for using the Class 1 command interface with
# an AT&T DataPort 14.4 modem.  Firmware version 122 (ati1)
# or newer.
#
# Hardware flow control is used by default.
#
# Note that due to a bug in the 1.22 firmware the FCS bytes in the HDLC
# frames are NOT returned to the host.  This is fixed in versions 1.33
# and later.  To deal with this problem, early firmware revs should be
# sure to have Class1FrameOverhead set to 2 instead of the normal 4.
#
# CONFIG:CLASS1:144:.*:.*: Manufacturer='AT&T' Model=Dataport
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class1		# use class 1 interface
ModemRate:		19200
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&R0\D1\Q3	# use RTS/CTS and enable RS232 handling
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&R1\D0\Q1	# use RTS/CTS and enable RS232 handling
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D2		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD follows carrier
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=0	# disable in case of Class 2 support
#
ModemMfrQueryCmd:	!AT&T
ModemModelQueryCmd:	!DataPort
ModemRevQueryCmd:	ATI19
#
# NB: this works around a bug in the 1.22 firmware; it is fixed
# in versions 1.33 and later in which case you can remove this
# line and use the default value of 4 (though leaving it as 2
# won't harm anything).
#
Class1FrameOverhead:	2		# 1.22 firmware does not include FCS
#
# The modem returns "OK" when there is a timeout before carrier is
# established.  This is treated as "NO CARRIER" by faxd.  Thus we
# need to up the NoCarrierRetrys parameter to avoid having the server
# reject jobs prematurely.
#
NoCarrierRetrys:	3		# retry 3 times on no carrier
#
PagerSetupCmds:		ATS41=10%B300	# use V.21 at 300 bps
