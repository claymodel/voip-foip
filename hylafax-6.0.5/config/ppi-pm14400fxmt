# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface

#
ModemType:		Class2
ModemRate:		19200		# rate for DCE-DTE communication
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemNoFlowCmd:		AT&K0           # setup no flow control
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT&K4           # setup software flow control
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT&K3		# setup hardware flow control
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D3		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD reflects carrier (or not)
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=1	# enable in current class
#
ModemSendFillOrder:	LSB2MSB		# as expected
ModemRecvFillOrder:	MSB2LSB		# opposite of what makes sense
#
# Configuration parameters for Class 2 modems.  Boy is this
# Class 2 implementation busted!  Aside from the usual AT+FDIS
# mistake it also sends a garbage RTC, so force the driver to
# explicitly append a good one.  Beware also that the host gets
# XON/XOFF on page data transmit no matter whether RTS/CTS flow
# control is enabled or not (hardware flow control *does* wor
# though).  Receive also automatically locks the line rate to
# 19200 and switches to XON/XOFF flow control (or so it appears).
#
Class2DDISCmd:		AT+FDIS		# enable workaround for broken +FDIS
Class2RecvDataTrigger:	"\022"		# character sent to modem to start recv
Class2SendRTC:		yes		# modem doesn't append RTC correctly
#
ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd:	"<19200><xon>"	# modem switches on fax receive
#
Class2BUGCmd:		AT+FBUG=0	# no support for HDLC frame tracing
