# Configuration for a GVC MAXTech 288 RC288DPi-based Class 2 modem.
# Tested with firmware rev KA1131-00.
#
# NB: DCD is toggled at page end during transmits; this can
#     cause problems on systems where it's not possible to
#     set CLOCAL and also enable RTS/CTS flow control.
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: GVC-*144DPI-*

# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2		# use class 1 interface
ModemRate:		19200		# locked for fax sending&receiving
ModemFlowControl:	rtscts		# default
#
ModemNoFlowCmd:		AT\Q0		# disable flow control cmd
ModemSoftFlowCmd:	AT\Q1		# software flow control cmd
ModemHardFlowCmd:	AT\Q3		# hardware flow control cmd
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D3		# DTR off causes modem to reset
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# DCD follows carrier
ModemSetupAACmd:	AT+FAA=1	# enable adaptive-answer in Class 2
#
ModemRecvFillOrder:	MSB2LSB		# bit order of received facsimile
ModemSendFillOrder:	LSB2MSB		# bit order modem expects for transmit
#
ModemDialCmd:		ATDT%s		# T for tone dialing
#
# Chip locks the line rate and switches to xon/xoff flow
# control when receiving facsimile--we must follow suit.
#
ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd:	"<19200><xon>"	# lock line rate & switch flow control
#
Class2RecvDataTrigger:	"\022"		# character sent to modem to start recv
#
# These are known to not be implemented on the GVC with the above
# firmware rev.  Sending them to the modem does not harm anything,
# but generates an ERROR result that can generate questions from the
# naive--so we disable them here.
#
Class2TBCCmd:		none		# setup stream mode
Class2PHCTOCmd:		none		# set phase C timeout parameter
