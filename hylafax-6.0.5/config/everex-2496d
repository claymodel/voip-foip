# Configuration for an Everex 24/96D.
#
# It may be possible to run the modem using RTS/CTS, but at the
# data rates it supports there's little point (and since everything
# works fine with XON/XOFF flow control, little motivation).
#
# CONFIG: CLASS2: Everex*-XONXOFF
# CONFIG: CLASS2: Everex*-DEFAULT
#
# BEGIN-SERVER
# END-SERVER
#
# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2		# use class 2 interface
ModemRate:		19200
ModemFlowControl:	xonxoff		# default
#
ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D3		# DTR off causes modem to reset
ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C0		# DCD always on
ModemDialCmd:		ATDT%s		# T for tone dialing
#
# Avoid BOR_C_REV 'cuz of a bug in the Everex modem firmware
# (Rev 901231 or earlier): BOR=3 and REL=1 generates garbage
# data in the EOL padding for received facsimile.
#
Class2BORCmd:		AT+FBOR=2	# direct phase C data, reversed B/D
Class2RELCmd:		AT+FREL=1	# enable byte-aligned EOLs
#
# NB: must break CQ=1 BADMUL= BADLIN= into separate lines
#     for the modem to grok
#
Class2CQCmd:		"AT+FCQ=1\nAT+FBADMUL=20\nAT+FBADLIN=10"
#
# Disable 2D-encoded data 'cuz some PROM versions appear
# to receive bad data (if you figure out why, then remove this).
