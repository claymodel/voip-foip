# Modem-related stuff: should reflect modem command interface
# and hardware connection/cabling (e.g. flow control).
#
ModemType:		Class2		# use this to supply a hint
#ModemRate:		19200		# max rate for DCE-DTE communication
#ModemFlowControl:	xonxoff		# XON/XOFF flow control assumed
#ModemSetupDTRCmd:	AT&D2		# setup so DTR drop resets modem
#ModemSetupDCDCmd:	AT&C1		# setup so DCD reflects carrier (or not)
#
# We can append the "@" symbol to the dial string so that
# the modem will wait 5 seconds before attempting to connect
# and return result codes that distinguish between no carrier
# and no answer.  This makes it possible to avoid problems with
# repeatedly dialing a number that doesn't have a fax machine
# (kudos to Stuart Lynne for this trick.)
#
# NB: If you need to prefix phone numbers to get through a PBX,
#     put it in the ModemDialCmd; e.g. "DT9%s@".
