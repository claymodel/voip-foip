# U10,U20-28F001BX-5.00 are known to work.
#
# RTS/CTS flow control is used.  The following profile was used:

# A shorter than normal timer is required for incoming calls to

# HACK:  Make sure the phone is on on-hook before answering in data mode.
# This allows a crude adaptive answer capability by taking advantage of
# the fact that, in the US at least, the phone company won't drop the
# caller for ten seconds.
