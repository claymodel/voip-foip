# prototype config for Digi AccelePort RAS
# It uses a K56 chip, but is similar in behavior to Lucents.
#
# Note that because the devices are named as "ttyG0_00" (which on some
# systems indicates a subdirectory, i.e. "ttyG0/00") you must:
# `ln -s /dev/ttyG0_00 /dev/ttyG000`
# for each device and refer to the symlink.  Otherwise various HylaFAX 
# functions will fail.
