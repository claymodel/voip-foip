hylafax (2:4.3.0-9) unstable; urgency=low

This new version uses lsb functions to manage start/stop daemons output, and
it also changes the FROM address of all emails that are now from "faxmaster".
If you wish to change it, you may as usual, customize /etc/hylafax/FaxNotify
and add FROMADDR="username@domain.tld".

hylafax (2:4.3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

This Debian version of hylafax will support PAM.  To enable such support,
you need to install an appropriate file under /etc/pam.d/.  An example
of such a file is in /usr/share/doc/hylafax-server/examples/.

hylafax (2:4.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

All versions of hylafax disabled PAM when installed.
This new version ships a very simple configuration file
in /usr/share/doc/hylafax-server/examples/pam-hylafax. To enable
PAM support just copy this file in /etc/pam.d and name it hylafax.

hylafax (1:4.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=high

Many hylafax installations have insecure entries in hosts.hfaxd.  The
problem is that if you enter "username" it will also match
"otherusername"; "host" will also match "hostname".

Unless you intend such behavior, you should modify your hosts.hfaxd to
use start and end delimiters as in the following examples:

  @192.168.0.[0-9]+$
  ^username@:uid:pass:adminpass
  ^user@host$

hylafax (1:4.2.0-16) unstable; urgency=medium

A script for storing cover pages is now added in the
/usr/share/doc/hylafax-server/examples directory. It should be
called in place of the supplied faxsend. It will merge the
cover page and the document and then call the real faxsend.

This workaround is taken from hylafax bug #603
(http://bugs.hylafax.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=603)
but it should be pointed that this is not really a bug, while a
wish that my users hope to be accepted by hylafax authors.

In order to use it, just copy it in any directory, like
/usr/local/bin/retainfaxcover.sh and add the following line to
/etc/hylafax/config:

  SendFaxCmd /usr/local/bin/retainfaxcover.sh

the restart hylafax calling '/etc/init.d/hylafax force-reload'

hylafax (1:4.2.0-8) unstable; urgency=low

The new init script that starts and stop hylafax have been changed
in order to better handle upgrade from previous versions of the sarge
package. This means that after calling start-stop-daemon, the script
will check if processes are still pending and will try to kill them.

I believe that this might be a problem if you are running many hylafax
servers in parallel (i.e., in different chroot environment). If you
happen to fall in ths case then please use the old script or modify
the new one.

Two Directories
----------------

In Debian Sarge release of hylafax, the client and server packages
have been completely reworked in order to fix many important bugs.

The major refactoring completely separated the environment where
the server run from the host machine. The server is run in a 
chroot environment starting at /var/spool/hylafax.

Since Debian policy requires that all configuration files must
be put in /etc, the chroot environment can not access them.
Hylafax used to be able to do so via links from 
/var/spool/hylafax/etc.

The two directories /var/spool/hylafax/etc and /etc/hylafax must
always contain identical files. All programs that update these files,
now update both copies at once.

Every file is "resynced" when the server starts, but to be more
safe in order to never overwrite a potencial "good" file, I decided
to write a statement about files not in sync and
ask for a bug report during the execution of /etc/init.d/hylafax.
The master copy of the files is /etc/hylafax when the server starts
via /etc/init.d/hylafax, but switch to /var/spool/hylafax/etc when
the server is running.
