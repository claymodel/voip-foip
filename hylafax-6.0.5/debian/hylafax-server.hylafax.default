# In a send only installation you may want to use faxgetty
# or faxmodem on lines already configured with faxaddmodem.
# faxgetty is the new default, faxmodem the old one.
# For a better understanding of the difference between faxmodem
# and faxgetty, see http://www.hylafax.org/archive/1999-09/msg00043.php
#
# In a send/receive installation you must use faxgetty.
#
# To use faxmodem change the following variable value to "no". 
#
# You may also prefer to run faxmodem/faxgetty via inittab instead of
# running it here from a script. In this case set its value as
# "init".
# USE_FAXGETTY=yes 

#
# Uncomment this line once hylafax has been fully configured and/or
# you want to enable the server.

# RUN_HYLAFAX=1

#
# If you need to bind hylafax to one address only, just uncomment
# this variable and change the value using your preferred IP.
#
# BINDTO="-l 127.0.0.1"

#
# The following variables are automatically assigned by running
# the faxsetup utility. If you leave them commented out then
# faxsetup values are used. You may specify here the values to
# use.

# OLDPROT="-o 4557"
# NEWPROT="-i 4559"
# SNPP="-s 444"

# hfaxd may be run from inetd while faxq should still be executed
# by the init script. If you run hfax via inetd or xinetd then
# uncomment the following line
# HFAXD_FROM_INET=true
