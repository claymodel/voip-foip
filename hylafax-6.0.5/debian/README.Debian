HylaFAX for Debian
==================

Welcome to Debian's HylaFAX distribution.

This document contains some notes specific to Debian's HylaFAX packages.
For general HylaFAX information, please see http://www.hylafax.org.

HylaFAX on Debian is split into three packages:

* hylafax-server:  the tools necessary to run a HylaFAX server that can send
  and receive facsimiles.  Please note, that you will need hylafax-client as
  well.

* hylafax-client:  the tools necessary to operate a local or remote HylaFAX
  server.  Install this package on networked clients.

1. Quick Start
--------------

The hylafax-server(5) manpage provides a nice overview of the various
HylaFAX components and how they interact with each other.  For further
guidance, please refer to the contents of the hylafax-doc package.

To get started you need to run faxaddmodem in order to let hylafax know about
the modem lines it have to use. Once faxaddmodem create a configuration file,
you need to communicate hylafax to us it. This is done automatically when
hylafax start or stop, using the command faxgetty (or the old faxmodem.)

If you want to change any global parameter (not related to a single modem line),
you need to run faxsetup. A first run is already done during hylafax install
with default parameters, but you may wish to change the default page size or
the protocol to use, or anything. After having change anything, please call
/etc/init.d/hylafax restart.


2. /etc/inittab & faxgetty
--------------------------

If you want your system to accept incoming fax calls via one or more modems,
you will need to run faxgetty on their respective ports.

In previous release of this package the suggested solution was to change
/etc/inittab and tell init to spawn a getty process.

Now a better approach has been implemented: a getty process is run
from /etc/init.d/hylafax if USE_FAXGETTY=yes in /etc/default/hylafax.
Please note that this is the default behaviour.

You may of course switch to using init changing to false that
variable and adding those lines to your /etc/inittab

#-- hylafax begin
# The following is example on how to use faxgetty for your modem lines.
# Please leave the lines with "hylafax begin" "hylafax end" in this file. If
# you decide to remove hylafax from this system then the parts between those
# comments will be erased and your inittab cleaned up.

#S0:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/faxgetty ttyS0
#S1:23:respawn:/usr/sbin/faxgetty ttyS1
#-- hylafax end

It is fairly straightforward.  If you modify /etc/inittab, make sure you do
"init q" in order to make init(8) reload it.

3. defaults
-----------

Using /etc/default/hylafax you may change some hylafax behaviour:
1. enabling or disabling it
2. specify to run faxgetty or faxmodem or none
3. specify on what addresses to listen to

Please have a look at the file and at all comments included.

USE_FAXGETTY is used to select how hylafax should connect to
modem lines. Hylafax may use faxmodem or faxgetty in order to "talk"
to serial lines. faxgetty is preferred over faxmodem for many reasons
and it is required in a send and receive configuration.

faxgetty or faxmodem can be runa when hylafax starts or when the
system boot, via init. If you prefer to use init, then change inittab
as specified on 2. and set USE_FAXGETTY="init". Otherwise set
USE_FAXGETTY="yes" for an automatic start of faxgetty when hylafax starts.
If you set USE_FAXGETTY="no" then hylafax will use faxmodem instead of
faxgetty.


4. Logging
----------

Default syslog facility:	local5	

Please also note, that hylafax-server doesn't modify /etc/syslog.conf either
now.  In order to create a separate log for HylaFAX messages add the
following line to your /etc/syslog.conf:

local5.*                       -/var/log/hylafax/hylafax.log

and issue an "/etc/init.d/sysklogd reload" command to activate the changes.  If
you are using syslog-ng please consult the appropriate documentation.

5. Faxmaster
------------

Previous versions of hylafax-server used to create alias for faxmaster
pointing to root.  Since sending email to root is insecure, modifying a file
belonging to another package is a policy violation and having in mind that
at least one popular MTA doesn't support /etc/aliases, that behaviour is
changed and hylafax-server now creates a separate account for the faxmaster.
By default, this user is disabled, i.e. nobody can login as faxmaster.
Please create an appropriate alias manually if you want to have
administrative messages sent to another user.  Alternatively, you can set
that user's password and have the mail messages retrieved somehow.

6. TagLine
----------

The tagline wasn't working until version 4.1.8-12. From that
version you may specify a font and a format to be used while
printing the tag line, using the faxaddmodem command or
editing the /etc/hylafax/config.DEVICE file by hand.

A font is already provided in the server package, so that
you may use it for this purpose. The TagLineFont should be
set to "etc/lutRS18.pcf".

7. Other notes
--------------

Default allow users: localhost 

hylafax can't use AdaptiveAnswer without these links:
	/etc/hylafax/getty-link -> /sbin/mgetty 
	/etc/hylafax/vgetty-link -> /usr/sbin/vgetty 
	/etc/hylafax/egetty-link -> /sbin/mgetty 


8. Feedback
-----------

Please use Debian's reportbug(1) utility to report problems.


9. PAM support
--------------

This Debian version of hylafax supports PAM.  To enable such support,
you need to install an appropriate file under /etc/pam.d/.  An example
of such a file is in /usr/share/doc/hylfax-server/examples/.

When /etc/pam.d/hylafax exists, it is automatically used, so you do not
have to use faxadduser, faxdeluser to modify hosts.hfaxd. All account
known to the system via PAM will be accepted as normal user.

When PAM authentication is used, you may optionally create a unix group
that will have admin rights on hylafax. If you setup such group than add
it in /etc/hylafax/config with "AdminGroup: groupname".

Please note that if you are storing your passwords in /etc/shadow, you
have to add the uucp user to the shadow group, otherwise the hylafax
daemon will not be able to check the passwords. If your PAM uses an
LDAP as backend, then this is not required.

10. e-mail encoding
-------------------

Hylafax is able to send received faxes via email. These emails
need to include base64 encoded attachments. Since this is not essential
to hylafax to work, you need to do manually some further steps:
you should install a package that provide encoders (like
mime-codecs or sharutils) and run 'faxsetup -server' that will
automatically check for those encoders and change its configuration.

11. sending UTF-8 files using sendfax
-------------------------------------

sendfax tries to convert any input file into postscript (if its original
format isn't TIFF or postscript) using a series of rules specified
in /etc/hylafax/typerules.
If you have to send text (non ASCII) files using this command then
install paps package and this line at the very end of typerules

0    byte    x       ps      paps --font-scale=10 %i >%o

then restart hylafax.
