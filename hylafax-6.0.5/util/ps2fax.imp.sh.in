# LaserWriter-specific stuff as well as to insert and error
# handler that generates ASCII diagnostic messages when
# a problem is encountered in the interpreter.

# NB: this shell script is assumed to be run from the
#     top of the spooling hierarchy -- s.t. the etc directory

FATAL ERROR: $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is missing!

The file $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is not present.  This
probably means the machine has not been setup using the faxsetup(@MANNUM1_8@)
command.  Read the documentation on setting up HylaFAX before you
startup a server system.

The Impressario PostScript RIP does not exist on the server machine
or is not located at the expected location:

    $PS

This indicates that you either do not have Impressario installed on
the system or that it is installed in a nonstandard location.

The FAX back-end for the Impressario PostScript RIP does not exist
on the server machine or is not located at the expected location:

    $DSO_DIR/fax.so

This indicates the Impressario 2.0 FAX back-end provided for use with
HylaFAX was not installed on the server system (hylafax.sw.imprip).
