# FAX Database entries are of the form:
#    <keyword> ":" <value>
# where keyword includes:
#    Name		name associated with destination fax machine
#    Company		company name
#    Location		in-company locational information; e.g. building#
#    FAX-Number		phone number through fax machine is reached
#
# Everything is free format.  Whitespace (blank, tab, newline) can be
# freely interspersed with tokens.  If tokens include whitespace, they
# must be encloseed in quote marks.
#
# The "#" character introduces a comment -- everything to the end of
# line is discarded.
#
# FAX applications that use the database access the information
# "by keyword" to place phone calls, format cover sheets, etc.
