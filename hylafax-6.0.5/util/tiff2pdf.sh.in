# Convert TIFF to pdf as needed.
#  the tiff2pdf that is part of ghostscript seems to choke on many tiffs 
#  without a bunch of help.  So, I extracted most of the code here from
#  faxrcvd and dropped it into a script.  So, that section of faxrcvd 
#  could eventually be simplified by also using this script.
#
# tiff2pdf [-o output] file ...
#
# NB: This script converts tiff files to pdf files instead of
#     using the ghostscript tiff2pdf which seems to blow up man times

FATAL ERROR: $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is missing!

The file $SPOOL/etc/setup.cache is not present.  This
probably means the machine has not been setup using the faxsetup(8C)
command.  Read the documentation on setting up HylaFAX before you
startup a server system.
