.TH XFERFAXLOG ${MANNUM4_5} "June 5, 1996"
.SH NAME
xferfaxlog \- \*(Fx activity log
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.B etc/xferfaxlog
contains information about inbound and outbound activities.
The file contains one line per inbound or outbound call
(except for facsimile documents retrieved by polling in which
case multiple entries may be present for a single call).
If the modem config setting
.I LogCalls
is set to true, then the file also contains one line per received call.
Lines are fixed-format,
.I tab-separated
.SM ASCII
strings.
.PP
Each record of a facsimile transmission is of the form:

The date and time of the transaction in the format
.SM "MM/DD/YY HH:MM",
where 
.SM MM
is the numeric month,
.SM DD
the numeric day,
.SM YY
the last two digits of the year, and
.SM HH:MM
is the time in 24-hour format.

.TP 14
.B modem
The device identifier for the modem that was used to do the send or receive.
.TP 14
.B jobid
The job number for outbound calls.
.TP 14
.B jobtag
The client-specified job tag for outbound calls.
.TP 14
.B fax.tif
The associated recvq fax TIFF file for the event.
.TP 14
.B sender
The sender/receiver's electronic mailing address
(facsimile receptions are always attributed to the ``fax'' user).
.TP 14
.B dest-number
The phone number dialed for outgoing calls.
.TP 14
.B \s-1TSI\s+1
The Transmitter Subscriber Identification string (as received) for
incoming calls.
.TP 14
.B \s-1CSI\s+1
The Caller Subscriber Identification string of the remote machine
(as reported) for outgoing calls.
.TP 14
.B local-number
The local phone number on which the data was received.
.TP 14

used for transferring data encoded as described below.
.TP 14
.B #pages
The total number of pages transferred.
.TP 14
.B jobtime
The duration of the session; in the format
\s-1HH:MM:SS\s+1.
This time includes setup overhead and any time
spent cleaning up after a call.
.TP 14
.B conntime
The time spent on the phone; in the format
\s-1HH:MM:SS\s+1.
This should be the time used by the PTT to calculate usage charges.

.B CIDName
The received CIDName value for the session.
.TP 14
.B CIDNumber
The received CIDNumber value for the session.

.PP
Note that fields may have embedded blanks.
Session parameters are encoded as a decimal number that contains
a packed set of Class 2 session parameter values.
The format is: 2 bits for vertical resolution, 3 bits for signalling rate,
3 bits for page width, 2 bits for page length, 2 bits for data format,
1 bit for ECM use, 1 bit of BF use, and 3 bits for the min scanline time.
The page counts are always integral numbers.
Partial pages that are to be retransmitted are not included
in the page count.
.PP
The simple 
.SM ASCII
format was designed to be easy to process with programs like
.IR awk (1).
.SH NOTES
The sender field does not necessarily represent the submitter's 
actual identity.  For example, it reflects the value given by
the
.IR sendfax (${MANNUM1_8})
``-f'' option.  Be cautious that this field is not utilized
for auditing if the fax user base is not trusted.
.SH BUGS
The date format will ``break'' in the year 2000.
Information should be recorded on a per-page basis for facsimile
communications.
