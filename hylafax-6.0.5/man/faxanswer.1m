.TH FAXANSWER ${MANNUM1_8} "May 23, 1996"
.SH NAME
faxanswer \- tell a \*(Fx server to answer the telephone
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/faxanswer
[
.B \-q
.I queue-dir
] [
.B \-h
.I how
]
.I modem
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxanswer
sends a message to the \*(Fx
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8})
process servicing
.I modem
telling it to answer the telephone.
This is useful, for example, when a modem is used on a
shared phone line and the server is
configured to not normally answer the phone.
.PP
The specified
.I modem
can either be the name (typically the
last component of the terminal port the
modem is attached to), or the full name
of the associated 
.SM FIFO
named pipe file, e.g. ``\s-1FIFO\s+1.ttym2''.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.BI \-q " dir"
Use a spooling area other than
.IR ${SPOOL} .
.TP 10
.B \-h
Specify exactly
.I how
the phone should
be answered.
By default, the server process is instructed
to answer the phone and
accept any kind of call (voice, data, fax).
Discrimination of the type of call is dependent on a modem's
.I "adaptive-answer"
support.
The
.B \-h
option can be used to force the server to answer the
phone for particular type of call: one of
.IR fax ,
.IR data ,
.IR voice ,
.IR any ,
.IR extern
(to force
.I faxgetty
to invoke an external application to
to handle the call),
or
.I dialX
(where X is a dialstring to dial before initiating a fax reception).
If using
.IR dialX ,
the specified dialstring will likely need to end with a semicolon (``;'').
