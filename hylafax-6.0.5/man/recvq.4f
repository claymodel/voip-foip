Image data is written using either
.SM "CCITT T.4"
or
.SM "CCITT T.6"
compression.
By default data is written using the compression scheme/data format
negotiated by the sender and receiver.
However, if
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8})
is configured to do copy quality checking
then data is written using the compression scheme defined by the
.B RecvDataFormat
configuration parameter; see
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
.PP
A scanline that is regenerated by the
receiver because of an error is typically just a copy of
the previous good scanline.
.PP
The files in the
.B recvq
directory are created with the protection mode specified
in the server configuration file(s).
By default, files are created with mode 0600 and owned
by the
.I fax
user, which means that they are accessible only to the fax user.
.PP
To print a facsimile on a \*(Ps\(rg printer, the
.IR fax2ps (1)
program can be used.
