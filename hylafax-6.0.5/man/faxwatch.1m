.TH FAXWATCH ${MANNUM1_8} "January 18, 1996"
.SH NAME
faxwatch \- monitor low-level \*(Fx server actions
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/faxwatch
[
.B \-g
] [
.B \-l
] [
.BI \-h " host"
]
.I trigger-expression
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxwatch
registers interest in one or more events on a \*(Fx server and
then prints subsequent event messages to the standard output.
The
.I faxwatch
program is intended mainly for testing the event distribution
mechanism used by the \*(Fx servers.
.PP
The
.I trigger-expression
is supplied as an argument to a ``\s-1SITE TRIGGER\s+1'' command
passed to the 
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8})
The syntax for this expression is:
.IP
[<\fIclass\fP>['<'\fIid\fP'>'][<\fImask\fP>|'*']]*
.PP
where <\fIclass\fP> defines a class of events and is one of:
.TP
.B J
for job-related events,
.TP
.B S
for fax send-related events,
.TP 
.B R
for fax receive-related events, and
.TP
.B M
for modem-related events.
.PP
A <\fImask\fP> is a 4-hex-digit mask of trigger events (see the
table below).
If ``*'' is specified then all events in the class are matched.
.PP
An <\fIid\fP> can be used to restrict matches to a specific
job or modem.  Eventually this will need to be generalized
for job groups.
.PP
Thus an example specification that would catch any event
for the modem on ttyf2 would be ``M<ttyf2>*'', and to be
notified when job 1932 is requeued or completes one would
use ``J<1932>4c60''.
.PP
The output from
.I faxwatch
is \s-1ASCII\s+1 text that describes each event.
.I faxwatch
runs until it is interrupted.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-g
Display times and dates in 
Greenwich Mean Time (\s-1GMT\s+1).
NB: \fIthis is the default\fP.
.TP 10
.BI \-h " host"
Report the status of the server on a specific
.IR host .
The
.I host
may be either a symbolic name or a network address.
If no
.B \-h
option is supplied,
.I faxwatch
uses the
.SM FAXSERVER
environment variable to identify the \*(Fx server to contact.
If this variable is not set, then
.I faxwatch
checks for a setting in the configuration files (first in the
per-user file and then in the system-wide file).
If all of the above fails, then
.I faxwatch
attempts to contact a server on the machine where it is run.
.TP 10
.B \-l
Display times and dates in the local timezone of the server.
.TP 10
.B \-v
Trace the protocol exchanges between
.I faxwatch
and the
.I hfaxd
processes on the standard output.
.SH EVENTS
The following table specifies the current set of events that may be
monitored.
