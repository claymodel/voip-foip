.TH DONEQ ${MANNUM4_5} "Feb 18, 2001"
.SH NAME
doneq/q* \- \*(Fx outbound job description
.SH DESCRIPTION
Files in the
.B doneq
directory specify transmission job requests.
These files are created by
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8}),
when submitting a job on behalf of
.IR sendfax (1)
or
.IR sendpage (1).
Job description files also reside in the
.B sendq
directory; they are moved from there to the doneq directory by
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8})
when a job completes.
.PP
Job description files are 
.SM ASCII
files with lines of the form
.sp .5
.ti +0.5i
\fBtag\fP: \fIvalue\fP
.sp .5
where a \fItag\fP is one of the identifiers described below
and a \fIvalue\fP is either a string or number.
Values start at the first non-blank character
after the ``:'' and continue to the end of the line.
Lines that end with a backslash character ``\e'' are continued
to the next line.
Numeric values are decimal integers, except for 
.B chophreshold
which is expressed as a floating point value.
.PP
The following table lists the possible tags and the required
type of the associated value.

so that
.IR notify (${MANNUM1_8})
can return it in a notification message.
.TP 14
.B desiredbr
The desired signalling rate to use for page data transmissions:
0 for 2400 bps, 1 for 4800 bps, 2 for 7200 bps, 3 for 9600 bps,

server machine).
Consult 
.I faxqclean
more details on other information that may be included in this string.
.TP 14

If the job cannot be completed in this number of calls, it is terminated.
.TP 14
.B maxtries
The maximum number of times the server should attempt to send a job; where
an attempt is defined to be a session that makes it past
Phase A of the 
.SM CCITT T.30
protocol (for facsimile), or similar.
If the job cannot be completed in this number of tries, it is terminated.
.TP 14
.B minsp
The minimum signalling rate to use for transmitting page data:
0 for 2400 bps (default), 1 for 4800 bps, 2 for 7200 bps, 3 for 9600 bps,
4 for 12000 bps, and 5 for 14400 bps.
.TP 14
.B modem
The outgoing modem to use to send the job, or ``any''
if any available modem is acceptable.
.TP 14
.B owner
The identity of the user that owns the job.
Typically the owner is the user that created the job, though clients
with administrative privileges can change the ownership of jobs.

\s-1USER\s+1 command passed to
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8})
when a client logins in to the server.
.TP 14
.B notify

.IR "when done+requeued" ''),
or not at all (``\c
.IR "none" '').
.TP 14

and to use in processing a page transmit request.
.TP 14
.B pagechop
Whether or not to automatically truncate trailing whitespace on pages
of outbound facsimile; see
.B PageChop
in
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
The possible values are: ``\c
.IR default ''
to use the setting of the
.B PageChop
configuration parameter, ``\c
.IR none ''
to disable page chopping, ``\c
.IR all ''
to enable chopping of all pages, and ``\c
.IR last ''
to enable chopping of the last page of each document.
.TP 14
.B pagehandling
A string that contains per-page information
used during facsimile transmission.
Most of the information is used in the negotiation
of session capabilities with optional information used in the
implementation of page chopping.
The string has three characters, say \fIxxc\fP,
for each page to be transmitted.
The \fIxx\fP characters are a hex-encoded specification
of the session capabilities required to transmit the page.
The \fIc\fP character is one of ``M'', ``S'', and ``P'';
where: ``M'' indicates there is another page to follow and
that the page requires different
.SM T.30
session parameters be negotiated (an
.SM EOM
code is to be transmitted).
``S'' indicates there is another page to follow, but the page
uses the same session parameters (an
.SM MPS.
code is to be transmitted).
``P'' indicates this is the last page to be transmitted (an
.SM EOP
code is to be transmitted).
In addition, if page chopping has been enabled and the page
has enough trailing whitespace to be a candidate, then
each three character string will be followed by a string of the
form ``\fIZXXXX\fP'', where ``XXXX'' is a 4 digit hex-encoded
count of the number of bytes of data to send for a chopped page.
.TP 14
.B pagelength
The desired page length in millimeters.
.TP 14

so that subsequent retries do not reprocess the document. 
.TP 14
.B poll
The value is a Caller Identification String (\c
.SM CIS\c
) to use in making a polling request.
If no 
.SM CIS
is specified then 
.I faxsend
will form one from the
.B FAXNumber
configuration parameter.
.TP 14
.B postscript
The pathname of a \*(Ps\(rg document to send.
Once a \*(Ps
document has been processed by 
.IR faxsend ,
it is marked as

.TP 14
.B receiver
The receiver's name.
This value is used only when creating continuation cover pages.
.TP 14

The desired vertical resolution in lines per inch.
This value should be either 98 or 196.
.TP 14
retrytime
The time, in seconds, to delay between each attempt to transmit a job
that fails because of a communication-oriented problem.
Normally jobs are scheduled according to a collection of configuration
parameters that are tuned for the specific reason of each failure;
e.g. see
.B JobReqProto
in
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
.TP 14
returned
Used internally to determine the last return value of the send
command issued for this job.
.TP 14
.B sender
The ``full name'' of the sender of the facsimile.
.TP 14

can return it in a notification message.
.TP 14
.B state
The job scheduling state.
Recognized values are:
1 (\fIsuspended\fP, not being scheduled),
2 (\fIpending\fP, waiting for the time to send),
3 (\fIsleeping\fP, waiting for a scheduled timeout),
4 (\fIblocked\fP, waiting for concurrent activity to the same destination to complete),
5 (\fIready\fP, ready to be processed except for available resources),
6 (\fIactive\fP, actively being processed by \*(Fx),
7 (\fIdone\fP, processing completed with success).
8 (\fIfailed\fP, processing completed with a failure).

.B subaddr
The SubAddress information to transmit when sending a facsimile.
This string should be used by the receiver to route received
facsimile documents.
.TP 14

.B tiff
The pathname of a 
.SM TIFF/F
document to send.
Once a
.SM TIFF
document has been processed by 
.IR faxsend ,
