.TH FAXGETTY ${MANNUM1_8} "July 31, 1995"
.SH NAME
faxgetty \- \*(Fx front-door process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${LIBEXEC}/faxgetty
[
.B \-D
] [
.B \-p
] [
.B \-q
.I queue-dir
]
.I device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxgetty
is the \*(Fx server program that listens for incoming phone calls
and either handles each call
directly or hands it off to an appropriate program.
In addition
.I faxgetty
monitors modem usage and notifies the \*(Fx scheduler process
when a modem's status changes; e.g. when a modem is busy
with an outbound call.
.PP
One
.I faxgetty
should be run for each facsimile modem on a machine.
.I faxgetty
is typically started by
.IR init (${MANNUM1_8}).
.I faxgetty
can also be used with data-only modems; this may be desirable if
some of the non-facsimile features are important, such as the
support for screening calls according to Caller-ID information.
.PP
.I faxgetty
listens to its facsimile modem for incoming calls
and to a
.SM FIFO
special file on which it accepts command directives from
administrative commands such as
.IR faxanswer (${MANNUM1_8})
and
.IR faxabort (${MANNUM1_8}).
.I faxgetty
also catches 
.SM SIGTERM
and
.SM SIGINT
signals; cleaning up any necessary resources before exiting.
.PP
Many aspects of
.I faxgetty
operation are controlled through a configuration file.
In particular, for 
.I faxgetty
to automatically invoke the
.IR getty (${MANNUM1_8})
program to handle incoming data connections the
.B GettyArgs
parameter must be setup in the configuration file.
The configuration file is located in the spooler hierarchy
in the
.B etc
subdirectory and is named
.BI config. devid ,
where
.I devid
is an identifier derived from the name of
the modem's device file; for example
.I ttym2
for
.IR /dev/ttym2 ,
.I term_10
for
.IR /dev/term/10 .
Consult
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5})
for detailed information on the contents of configuration files.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-D
This option forces
.I faxgetty
to detach itself from the controlling tty from which it was invoked.
In normal operation
.I faxgetty
will 
.B not
disassociate itself from the controlling tty.
.TP 10
.B \-p
Do not change the process priority when receiving facsimile.
Normally
.I faxgetty
will raise its priority to reduce i/o latency.
This option is useful for debugging.
.TP 10
.BI \-q " dir"
The specified directory is treated as the spooling area.
The default spooling area,
.IR ${SPOOL} ,
is defined at the time the software is built.
.SH FILES
.ta \w'${SPOOL}/etc/config.\fIdevice\fP    'u

${SPOOL}/FIFO.\fIdevice\fP	FIFO special file for submitting commands

Consult
.IR hylafax-server (${MANNUM4_5})
for a complete discussion of the structure and
content of the spooling area.
