.SH NAME
faxmail \- \*(Fx mail-to-fax gateway application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B faxmail
[
.I options
] [
.I destination
[
.I from
] ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxmail
takes an electronic mail message on standard input
and submits it as a facsimile to a \*(Fx server for transmission.
.PP
.I faxmail
is designed for use in constructing electronic mail to facsimile
gateway services.
For example, mail aliases may be created to automatically
transmit electronic mail; e.g.
.PP
.nf
.ti +0.5i
sam: "|${BIN}/faxmail sam@5551212"
.fi
or 
.I faxmail
may be used as a ``mail transport agent'', extracting the necessary
delivery information directly from the envelope of the mail message.
.PP
.SH FORMATTING
.I faxmail
formats a mail message according to the following rules:
First it parses the envelope information interpreting any
meta-header information (see below) that is present.
Once the entire envelope has been collected it emits a
formatted set of header lines.
By default all header information except the
``From'', ``To'', ``Cc'', ``Subject'', and ``Date''
lines are discarded.
Header lines that are kept have the 
.I tag
(the string to the left of the ``:'')
set in a \fIbold font\fP and the
.I value
(the string to the right of the ``:'')
set in an \fIitalic font\fP.
Mail messages that conform to the Multipurpose Internet
Mail Extensions (\s-1MIME\s+1) specification are parsed
and handled according to the rules given below.
Plain text body parts of a mail message are formatted in a
\fItext font\fP with any long lines wrapped at
word boundaries unless the
.B \-c
option has been specified.
.PP
By default,
.I faxmail
sets all text in 10 point type on an 8.5" by 11" portrait-oriented page
with .35" top margin, .25" bottom margin and .25" left and right
hand margins.
There are command-line options to control the point size,
page dimensions, orientation, and multi-column formatting.
Text formatting can also be controlled through meta-header
directives placed in the envelope of the mail message.
.SH "ENVELOPE PROCESSING"
.I faxmail
pre-processes the envelope information (i.e. the header lines) before
formatting the message contents.
Header lines whose names begin with ``X-FAX-'' (case-insensitive) are
handled specially\-they are treated as command directives that specify
how to generate the resultant \*(Ps or, optionally, how to deliver
the resulting document as facsimile.
The set of known meta-headers corresponds to the set of configuration
parameters defined below.
A meta-header is specified as ``X-FAX-\fIparameter\fP'' where
.I parameter
is the name of a configuration parameter; e.g.
``X-FAX-TabStop'' to set the number of spaces between tab stops.
.PP
Controls for specifying headers to be passed through
in the formatted text identify not only which headers but also the
order in which the headers should be emitted.
.I faxmail
initializes the set of headers to retain to: ``To From Subject Cc Date''.
If this order is acceptable then additional headers can simply 
be added with the
X-FAX-Headers directive; e.g. ``X-FAX-Headers: Message-id''.
If however a different order is desired then the header
set should be cleared with a ``clear'' header tag
and then completely specified in the desired order; for example,
.nf
.sp
X-FAX-Headers: clear Message-id Date To Subject From Cc
.fi
.PP
will cause headers to be emitted in the order
``Message-Id Date To Subject From Cc'' (depending on what headers
are present).
Note in particular that all header lines in the envelope can
be suppressed by specifying ``X-FAX-Headers: clear''; this is
useful, for example, when the body of the mail message contains
a preformatted document that is to be transmitted.
.PP
In addition to the above controls,
.I faxmail
can also be instructed to substitute an arbitrary string for a header
tag when generating the final envelope.
This facility can be used to better format ad-hoc header information
that is passed through the envelope of the message.
The ``X-FAX-MapHeader'' meta-header specifies how to map a header line.
For example,
.nf
.sp
X-FAX-MapHeader: x_FAX_For Deliver FAX To
.fi
.sp
would cause any header ``x_FAX_For'' that appeared in the envelope
to be replaced in the formatted envelope by ``Deliver FAX To''.
.SH "MIME PROCESSING"
.I faxmail
parses 
.SM MIME
mail messages and does some rudimentary work to:
.IP \(bu 3
decode encoded parts,
.IP \(bu 3
formats the message and text parts into a Postscript document
.IP \(bu 3
insert ``digest dividers'' between multipart/digest subparts,
.IP \(bu 3
format message/rfc822 parts as described above for the top-level envelope, and
.IP \(bu 3
submit all other attached documents to be faxed.
.PP
.SM MIME
processing is fairly simple and (currently) somewhat constrained.
.I faxmail
has builtin support for the following MIME parts:
text/plain, multipart/mixed, multipart/digest, message/rfc822,
application/postscript, and application/x-faxmail-prolog.
Parts can also be processed through external processing scripts that
.I faxmail
looks for in a ``\s-1MIME\s+1 converters'' directory hierachy.
External scripts may override builtin processing or suppliment the builtin support.
For each
.SM MIME
body part with type
.I T
and subtype
.I S
.I faxmail
checks first for an exceutable script named T/S in the converter heirarchy.
If a script exists then it is run and the resulting output is saved as a
document submitted to \*(Fx.  If the output is empty, the part is
suppressed, and will not be submitted.
All other parts will be saved as documents and submitted to \*(Fx.
.I faxmail
uses the
.IR typerules (${MANNUM4_5}).
mechanism to convert file formats into
one of the format \*(Fx supports.
.PP
The builtin handling support is as follows:
text/plain parts are formatted using the default \fItext font\fP
and point size;
multipart/mixed are ``burst'' and interpreted per the specification
but are otherwise unformatted;
multipart/digest are burst and an optional ``digest divider'' marking
may be inserted before each subpart;
message/rfc822 are formatted as described above with envelope header
lines culled and formatted with bold and italic fonts
(in addition, if there is insufficient space in the current output page/column
for the message envelope, optional divider, and one line of text, then
.I faxmail
will insert a ``break'' so the the message starts at the top of the next
page/column);
application/postscript are copied through untouched to the output;
application/x-faxmail-prolog are copied through untouched to the
end of the prologue section of the generated PostScript document
to permit customization of the formatted output.
.PP
.I faxmail
supports the following Content-Transfer-Encoding schemes:
7bit, 8bit, binary, base64, quoted-printable, and x-uuencode.
Any character set that is not us-ascii is treated as iso-8859-1.
.SH "SERVER DELIVERY"
When
.I faxmail
is invoked it delivers the formatted document directly to a \*(Fx
server for transmission as facsimile.
Command line arguments may be supplied to specify the 
delivery destination and sender identity; typically from
information extracted by the mail transport facility.
A command line
.I destination
is specified with the same syntax as
the argument for the
.B \-d
option to the
.IR sendfax (1)
command.
Similarly any
.I from
identity specified on the command line follows the same rules
as the
.B \-f
option to
.IR sendfax .
An explicit dialstring to use in delivery can also be specified with an
X-FAX-Dialstring header in the mail message envelope.
If no sender identity is provided on the command line then
.I faxmail
will extract it from the ``From'' line in the envelope.
.I faxmail
will not submit a message for delivery if either the dialstring
or sender identity is missing or null.
.PP
X-FAX- header lines may be included in the mail message envelope to control
the submission and delivery process.
As above these lines are specified as ``X-FAX-\fIparameter\fP'' where
.I parameter
is the name of a configuration parameter for the
.I sendfax
program; e.g.
``X-FAX-VRes'' to set the vertical resolution of the transmitted facsimile.
By default automatic cover page generation is enabled when direct
delivery is used; this can be overridden with the
.B \-n
option on the command line or by including an
X-FAX-AutoCoverPage header in the message envelope.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-1
Set text in one column (default).
.TP 10
.B \-2
Set text two columns.
.TP 10
.BI \-b " font"

.I us-exe
(American Executive),
.I jp-let
(Japanese Letter),
and
.I jp-leg
(Japanese Legal).
Comparisons are case-insensitive and any match of a
substring of the full page-size name is sufficient; e.g. ``legal'' would
match ``American Legal''.
.TP 10
.BI \-t " notify"
Specify the notify value to use
.TP 10
.BI \-T 
Trim leading blank lines from text parts.  If the text part is completely

.SM MIME,
and
job submission processing.
Diagnostic information is written to the standard error (envelope
and MIME processing) and standard output (job submission).
.TP 10
.BI \-W " width"
Use
.I width
as the width, in inches, of the output page.
The default page width is taken from the default page size.

(Equivalent to the
.B \-p
option.)
.TP 15
.B Verbose
Control tracing envelope and MIME processing.
.SH NOTES
Because a sender's identity in an electronic mail message is inherently
untrustworthy, using
.I faxmail
to build a mail to fax gateway is problematic.
Unless mail service is
somehow restricted or the sender's identity is verified using a mechanism
such as RFC 1847's multipart/signed MIME type
there is no reliable way to restrict access to facilities
setup with 
.IR faxmail .
.SH BUGS
Only the last instance of a header is kept and written to the output.
This means, for example, that only the last of many ``Received'' lines
will be included in the formatted output.
