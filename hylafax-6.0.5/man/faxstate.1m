.TH FAXSTATE ${MANNUM1_8} "July 17, 1995"
.SH NAME
faxstate \- control ``modem state'' of a device used by \*(Fx
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/faxstate
[
.B \-q
.I queue-dir
] [
.B \-s
.I state
] [
.B \-n
]
.I modem
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxstate
sends a message to the \*(Fx
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8})
process servicing
.I modem
telling it to use the specified state when notifying the
\*(Fx scheduler that a modem is ready and available for use.
This is useful for controlling outbound use of a modem; by
marking a modem's state as 
.I busy
or
.I down
the \*(Fx scheduler will not assign any outbound jobs to the modem.
.PP
The specified
.I modem
can either be the name (typically the
last component of the terminal port the
modem is attached to), or the full name
of the associated 
.SM FIFO
named pipe file, e.g. ``\s-1FIFO\s+1.ttym2''.
.PP
If the
.B \-n
option, 
.I faxstate
emulates what 
.I faxgetty
would do; sending a message directly to the
.I faxq
process marking the specified modem down, busy, or ready.
This interface is useful for send-only environments in which
.I faxgetty
processes are not used.
Note that modems manipulated in this way must previously have
been configured with the
.IR faxmodem (${MANNUM1_8})
program.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are supported:
.TP 10
.B \-n
Contact
.I faxq
directly instead of
.IR faxgetty .
.TP 10
.BI \-q " dir"
Use a spooling area other than
.IR ${SPOOL} .
.TP 10
.B \-s
Specify the state to send the
.I faxq
process each time the modem becomes ready for use; one of ``\c
.IR busy '',
``\c
.IR down '',
and ``\c
.IR ready ''.
The default state to use is 
.IR ready .
.SH FILES
Consult
.IR hylafax-server (${MANNUM4_5})
for a complete discussion of the structure and
content of the spooling area.
