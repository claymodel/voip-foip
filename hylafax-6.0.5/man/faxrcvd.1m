.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bin/faxrcvd
is the command script invoked by the facsimile server whenever
a facsimile is received.
The default script sends electronic mail to the 
.I FaxMaster
user describing the content of the facsimile and other useful information
such as the time spent receiving the document.
The arguments are:
.TP 10
.B qfile
the pathname of the received 
.SM TIFF
file relative to the root of the spooling hierarchy.
.TP
.B devid
the modem device on which the facsimile was received.
.TP 
.B commid
the communication identifier for the inbound call.
.TP
.B error-msg
an error message that is non-null if an error was encountered
during the receive operation.
.TP
.B callid
the value of various identification indicators from the call
.SH NOTES
This script can route facsimile directly to the intended recipient.
To do this create a shell script
.B etc/FaxDispatch
in the spooling area that sets
.I SENDTO
to the receiver's electronic mail address.  For example,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\s-1case "$SENDER" in
*1*510*526*1212*) SENDTO=sam;;          # Sam's test rig in Berkeley
*1*415*390*1212*) SENDTO=raster@asd;;   # 7L Xerox room, used for scanning
*5107811212)      SENDTO=peebles@mti;;  # stuff from home
esac
case "$DEVICE" in
ttyS1)            SENDTO=john;;         # all faxes received on ttyS1
ttyLT0)           SENDTO=mary@home;;    # all faxes received on ttyLT0
esac
case "$CIDNUMBER" in
435*)        SENDTO=lee; FILETYPE=pdf;; # all faxes from area code 435
5059627777)  SENDTO=amy; FILETYPE=tif;; # Amy wants faxes in TIFF
esac\s+1
case "$SUBADDR" in
53)          SENDTO=FaxMaster;;         # without double-notification
roger)       SENDTO=roger;;             # possible text subaddressing
esac\s+1
.ft R
.fi
.sp
Note that you must match any embedded white space.
The facsimile will be sent as a MIME-encoded PostScript document
as default.
.TP
.I CALLIDn
is equivalent to the nth call identification parameter
.TP
.I CIDNAME
is equivalent to
.B CALLID2
above.
.TP
.I CIDNUMBER
is equivalent to
.B CALLID1
above.
.TP
.I DEVICE
is equivalent to
.B device
above.
.TP
.I FILETYPE
controls the filetype of the image attachment.  Current
filetype options are ``ps'', ``tif'', and ``pdf''.
Multiple values may be specified by separating them with
whitespace. In that case a separate attachment is created
for each filetype.
.TP
.I FROMADDR
controls the sender of the received fax notification.  It is
given as an e-mail address.
.TP
.I MSG
is equivalent to
.B error-msg
above.
.TP
.I NOTIFY_FAXMASTER
(an underscore ``_'' character is between NOTIFY and FAXMASTER)
indicates whether or not the HylaFAX administrator should be notified
regarding incoming facsimile.  Default is ``always''.  Also available are
``never'', which means to never send any received facsimile notification,
and ``errors'', which means to send notification only if there were
reception errors.
.TP
.I SENDER
is the received TSI of the fax sender.
.TP
.I SENDTO
controls the recipient of the received fax notification.  It is given as an
e-mail address, and it's value will be passed directly to the MTA for delivery
as well as being inserted into the email.  If you want to send to multiple
receipients in seperate messages set the variable SENDTO1...SENDTOn in addition
to SENDTO.  faxrcvd will process additional SENDTOn variables starting at 1,
and stopping at the first empty SENDTOn variable it finds.  The templates
should continue to reference $SENDTO, and faxrcvd will make sure it get's set
correctly as the template is processed for each one.
.TP
.I SUBADDR
the received subaddress value, communicated by the sender for 
post-reception routing purposes
.TP
.I TEMPLATE
the template subdirectory to use when sending e-mails.  HylaFAX ships with
a base set of templates, and some direct translations.  To use the German
translated templates, set TEMPLATE=de in FaxDispatch.  This is relative to the
base template directory.
.TP
Other shell variables are available.  Consult the faxrcvd script directly.
