.SH NAME
faxrm \- remove a \*(Fx job or document from a server
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B faxrm
[
.B \-a
] [
.B \-d
] [
.B \-v
] [
.B \-h
.I hostname
]
.IR id ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxrm
removes one or more jobs or documents from a \*(Fx server.
If a job that is to be removed is being processed by a server,
it is first aborted.
.PP
An 
.I id
is either a number that identifies a
.I job
(default) or, if the
.B \-d
option is specified, a document pathname.
Job identifiers are printed by
.IR sendfax (1)
when jobs are queued for transmission; they can also be displayed with
.IR faxstat (1).
The names of documents associated with outbound jobs
can be seen by supplying the
.B \-f
option to
.IR faxstat .
Documents in the receive queue can be viewed with the 
.B \-r
option to
.IR faxstat .
.PP
Unprivileged users can only remove jobs or documents that they own.
Clients with administrative privileges can remove any job or document
(see the
.B \-a
option below).  The user name may be specified by the
.B FAXUSER
environment variable.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-a
Use administrative privileges;
.I faxrm
will prompt for the password to set administrative privileges.
.TP 10
.B \-d
Interpret each
.I id
as a document pathname.
If a pathname does not begin with ``/'' then
.I faxrm
automatically prepends ``/docq/''.
.TP 10
.BI \-h " host"
Contact the server at the specified 
.IR host .
The
.I host
may be either a symbolic name or a network address.
If no server is specified then
If no
.B \-h
option is supplied,
.I faxrm
uses the
.SM FAXSERVER
environment variable to identify the \*(Fx server to contact.
If this variable is not set, then
.I faxrm
checks for a setting in the configuration files (first in the
per-user file and then in the system-wide file).
If all of the above fails, then
.I faxrm
attempts to contact a server on the machine where it is run.
.TP
.B \-v
Trace the protocol messages to and from the server.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.I faxrm
reads configuration information from the file
.B ${LIBDATA}/hyla.conf
and then from the file
.BR ~/.hylarc .
Configuration files follow the conventions described in
.IR hylafax-client (1).
The following configuration parameters are recognized:
