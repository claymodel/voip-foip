.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bin/notify
is the command script invoked by the facsimile server to notify a
user about the status of an outbound job.
The default notification script sends the user
electronic mail describing the event or action.
The arguments are:
.TP 10
.B qfile
the pathname of the job description file.
.TP
.B why
a string that specifies why the user is being notified; one of:
.sp .5
.nf
.ta  +\w'poll_no_document    'u +\w'Notes    'u

.sp .5

.br
\(S1 A final job state
.br
\(S2 A transcript of the failed communication is returned
to the sender.
.br
\(S3 No emails are sent for the block state, the job has been neither requeued nor done, but remains waiting
in the queue for the ability to be sent.
.TP
.B jobtime
the total transmission time of a successful job or the connect
time of a failed request (passed as a string).
.TP
.B nextTry
the time (passed as a string) at which the next attempt will be
made to complete the job.
This parameter is passed only if
.B why
is ``requeued''.
.SH NOTES
The behavior of
.B notify
is intended to be customizable via the
.B etc/FaxNotify
script, if present.  FaxNotify is sourced after the q-file is parsed and
all default values are preset.  Useful settings for FaxNotify are:
.TP
.I WHY
is identical to
.B why
mentioned above and can be useful in determining under what conditions
various settings should take effect.  For example,
.sp
.nf
.ft C
if [ "$WHY" != "done" ]; then
    RETURNFILETYPE=pdf;
fi
.ft R
.fi
.sp
This would only set
.B RETURNFILETYPE
when the job did not complete successfully.
.TP
.I RETURNFILETYPE
can be set to ``tif'', ``pdf'', ``ps'', or ``original''.  If set,
this causes
.B notify
to return a copy of the submitted documents to the
.B SENDER
address along with the notification message.  The ``original'' setting
uses the format type that was used in the submission.
Multiple values may be specified by separating them with
whitespace. In that case a separate attachment is created
for each filetype.
.TP
.I NOTIFY_FAXMASTER
is used to deliver a notification message to
.B TOADDR
(which defaults to ``FaxMaster'') that contains technical information
about the job.  This is useful in allowing the administrator to be aware of
any problems before those problems are reported by the users.
Possible settings are ``yes'', ``always'', ``no'', ``never'', and ``errors''.
If ``errors'' is used then the notification message is only sent to FaxMaster
when the job experienced an error.  The default is ``no''.
.P
The settings of the user in
.B $notify
(read from the
.B sendq
job file) controls whether the user will get the notification email.  If you want to force
notification emails, irregardless of the users selection, or force a blocked notification (which is
not sent by default), you can set
.sp
.nf
.ft C
notify="always"
.ft R
.fi
.sp
which will force the notify script to send the email.
