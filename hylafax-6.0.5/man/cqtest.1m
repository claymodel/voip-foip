.TH CQTEST ${MANNUM1_8} "October 3, 1995"
.SH NAME
cqtest \- \*(Fx copy quality checking test program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/cqtest
[
.I options
] input.tif
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I cqtest
is a program for testing the copy quality checking support in
the \*(Fx software (specifically, in the
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8})
program).
.I cqtest
takes a
.SM TIFF/F
(\c
.SM TIFF
Class F) file and
generates a new
.SM TIFF/F
file that is a copy of the input file, but with any erroneous scanlines
replaced/regenerated.
In addition,
.I cqtest
prints diagnostic messages describing its actions and indicates whether
the input data has acceptable copy quality according to the copy
quality checking threshold parameters.
Options are provided for specifying 
copy quality checking threshold parameters
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 14
.BI \-m " badlines"
Set the maximum consecutive bad lines of data that may
appear in each acceptable page of input data.
This is equivalent to the
.B MaxConsecutiveBadLines
configuration parameter; c.f.
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
By default 
.I cqtest
accepts no more than 5 consecutive bad lines in a page.
.TP
.BI \-o " file"
Write output to
.IR file .
By default output is written to the file
.BR cq.tif .
.TP
.BI \-p " %goodlines"
Set the minimum percentage of ``good lines'' of data that
may appear in acceptable page of input data.
A line is good if it decodes without error to a row of pixels
that is the expected width.
This is equivalent to the
.B PercentGoodLines
configuration parameter; c.f.
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
By default 
.I cqtest
requires that 95% of the rows of each page be good.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following shows a multi-page, high-resolution document with a
single error on each page.  Each page has acceptable
copy quality using the default threshold parameters.
