.TH FAXSETUP ${MANNUM1_8} "August 26, 1996"
.SH NAME
faxsetup \- setup a machine for use with \*(Fx
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/faxsetup
[
.B \-client
] [
.B \-server
] [
.BI \-with-VAR [=value]
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxsetup
is an interactive shell script that does the
necessary setup work to configure a client or server machine
for the \*(Fx software.
.I faxsetup
must be run on every \*(Fx server machine before the software
will function\-if a \*(Fx server program or script is invoked before
.I faxsetup
is run, the command will abort with a message that says to run
.IR faxsetup .
.I faxsetup
may optionally be run on a \*(Fx client machine to verify the
configuration of the software.
.PP
By default
.I faxsetup
checks a machine for use both as a \*(Fx client and server.
Client-specific checks include:
.IP \(bu 3
the installation of client programs and data,
.IP \(bu 3
the installation of the Adobe Font Metric (\s-1AFM\s+1) information
files used by the \*(Fx text formatting support.
.LP
Server-specific checks include:
.IP \(bu 3
the installation of server programs and data,
.IP \(bu 3
the existence of the \s-1UUCP\s+1 lock file directory,
.IP \(bu 3
the installation of the \s-1TIFF\s+1 software tools,
.IP \(bu 3
the configuration of the getty programs invoked for data and voice calls,
.IP \(bu 3
the pathnames for various system programs used by server shell scripts,
.IP \(bu 3
proper support for \s-1FIFO\s+1 special files,
.IP \(bu 3
proper installation of a \*(Ps \s-1RIP\s+1,
.IP \(bu 3
definition of a ``fax'' user,
.IP \(bu 3
definitions for the ``hylafax'' and ``snpp'' services,
.IP \(bu 3
startup of the \*(Fx server processes:
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8})
and
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8}),
.IP \(bu 3
definition of a ``FaxMaster'' mail alias for reporting server problems.
.PP
For server machines
.I faxsetup
also creates two files that are required by the \*(Fx command scripts.
One file contains master configuration parameters and the other
contains various definitions used by scripts such as
.IR faxaddmodem (${MANNUM1_8})
that communicate with modems.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-client
Do client-specific consistency checks.
.TP 10
.B \-server
Do server-specific consistency checks.
.TP 10
.BI \-with-VAR "[=value]"
Override the default definition for the configuration parameter named
.BR VAR ;
optionally specifying a new
.I value 
(if no value is specified then ``yes'' is used).
This option is especially useful to override the default settings
for the \*(Ps interpreter package to use (e.g. ``-with-PS=dps''),
the spooling directory (``-with-DIR_SPOOL=/mumble''), the 
directory where the tool applications of
.SM TIFF
software distribution are located (``-with-TIFFBIN=/usr/freeware''),
etc.
A complete list of the possible parameters can be found by looking
at the contents of the
.I faxsetup
shell script;
many of these configuration parameters are also
described in the
.SM online
documentation
.TP 10
.B \-help
Print a help message and terminate.
.TP 10
.B \-quiet
Do not print verbose messages to the terminal.
.TP 10
.B \-verbose
Print informative messages to the terminal (default).
.SH BUGS
.I faxsetup
does not query a modem to find out its capabilities when invoking the
.I faxmodem
program to setup a server in a send-only configuration; it may be
necessary to run
.I faxmodem
manually.
.SH FILES

content of the spooling area.
