.SH NAME
info \- remote device capability database
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B info
subdirectory in the \*(Fx
spooling area holds information about the capabilities
and status of devices that have been called.
One file exists for each device, with the filename
created from the remote device's fully-qualified
phone number.
Files have a simple
.SM ASCII
format.
Each line is of the form
.sp .5
.ti +0.5i
[\fB&\fP]\fBtag\fP: \fIvalue\fP
.br
.sp .5
where a \fItag\fP identifies a capability and a \fIvalue\fP
is either a string, number, or boolean value.
An optional ``&'' at the front of the line indicates that the
tag's value is
.I "locked down"
and should not be updated by the server.
This facility is useful for restricting the capabilities used
with a particular machine.
.PP
The following items are recorded:
.RS

.PP
The \*(Fx scheduler,
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8}),
uses the information stored in this directory when
deciding if a call should be placed and when
preparing documents for transmission.
If a remote device's capabilities are known, then
document preparation is constrained and/or optimized
according to the capabilities.
Otherwise, documents are prepared without regard for
the remote device's capabilities and if a capability mismatch
is encountered the session is terminated and the documents
are reformatted using the newly discovered capabilities.
.PP
The
.I calledBefore
item is used by 
.I faxsend
to decide whether or not to redial a phone number
when encountering certain errors.
For example, if a dialing command results in a ``\s-1NO CARRIER\s+1''
result, then the number will not be retried unless
the number has previously been dialed successfully.
.PP
The
.I minScanlineTime
item indicates the minimum scanline time parameter
used for facsimile transmissions.
Acceptable values are:
``0ms'',
``5ms'',
``10ms/5ms'',
``10ms'',
``20ms/10ms'',
``20ms'',
``40ms/20ms'',
and
``40ms''.
(Values of the form 
.I X/Y
mean to use 
.I X
for 98 lpi images and 
.I Y
for 196 lpi images.)
.PP
The
.I pagerTTYParity
item specifies the communication parameters to use when communicating
with the
.SM IXO/TAP
service provider.
Acceptable values are:
``even'' (7 bits, even parity),
``odd'' (7 bits, odd parity),
and
``none'' (8 bits, no parity).
If nothing is specified then ``even'' is used per the standard.
.PP
The
.IR pagerMaxMsgLength ,
.IR pagerPassword ,
and
.I pagerTTYParity
items can be setup according to the requirements of a pager
service provider; they typically are locked down so that their
values are not lost during updates.
.PP
The
.IR pagerSetupCmds
can be used to define AT commands for setting up the modem
for a specific service provider.
This value overwrites the settings defined in
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
.PP
The
.IR pageSource
parameter can be used to tell the paging central who we are.
It usually contains a SMS answerable mobile number. It is only
used for the \s-1UCP\s+1 part of
.IR sendpage (${MANNUM1_8}).
\fBNote: \fR This parameter should be used from user-land
.IR sendpage (1)
and will be removed later.
.PP
The
.IR pagingProtocol
defines which protocol, \s-1UCP\s+1 or \s-1IXO\s+1, should
be used to send the message to the service provider. It
defaults to ``ixo''; for \s-1UCP\s+1 set ``ucp''.
.SH NOTES
.IR faxsend ,
.IR pagesend ,
and
.I faxq
automatically create and update entries in the
.B info
directory, as required.
.PP
The data in this directory is simply a
.I cache
of remote capabilities and, except for locked down items, can be
safely purged at any time.
The
.IR faxcron (${MANNUM1_8})
script, for example, periodically purges unlocked entries in this
directory that have not been accessed in 30 days.
.PP
When the first batching attempt fails then
.IR supportsBatching
is set to false.  It must be manually altered in order to re-enable
batching to the destination.
.PP
Restricting the capabilities used with a particular machine to a value
other than those that are mandatory can cause documents to be sent
outside of an acceptable range for the receiver.
