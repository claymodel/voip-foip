.TH FAXSTAT 1 "July 9, 1996"
.SH NAME
faxstat \- display \*(Fx status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B faxstat
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxstat
reports the status of \*(Fx servers, including (potentially)
the status of the send, receive, done, document, and archive directories.
When invoked without options
.I faxstat
reports only the status of the server; the options
described below can be used to override this behaviour.
.PP
Server status information indicates the state of the
server (idle, sending, receiving, etc.)
and the phone number that is associated with the fax modem.
.PP
The job queue report give the status of facsimile jobs
queued for transmission; by default:
.IP \(bu 3
the job identifier,
.IP \(bu 3
the job state (see below for the description of the
.B a
format in the
.B JobFmt
string),
.IP \(bu 3
the modem or modem class the job is bound to (``any'' if the job
can be sent though any modem),
.IP \(bu 3
the destination (phone number) of the job,
.IP \(bu 3
the time to send the job, or a blank field if the job is being
processed or is to be sent immediately,
.IP \(bu 3
the job's owner,
.IP \(bu 3
and status information about the job (typically the reason why
a previous attempt failed).
.PP
The receive queue report lists the facsimile documents
that have been received and are awaiting delivery; by default it
includes:
.IP \(bu 3
the document protection mode,
.IP \(bu 3
the number of pages,
.IP \(bu 3
the document's owner,
.IP \(bu 3
the phone number of the sender (if supplied),
.IP \(bu 3
the date and time at which the job was received, and
.IP \(bu 3
the filename of the document in the \fBrecvq\fP
directory on the server machine.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-a
Display the contents of the
.B archive
directory on the server machine
.TP 10
.B \-d
Display the status of all jobs that have completed; i.e. those
jobs located in the
.B doneq
directory on the server machine.
The
.B JobFmt
string defines the content and format of information reported with
this option.
.TP 10
.B \-f
Display the status of document files located in the
.B docq
directory on the server machine.
The
.B FileFmt
string defines the content and format of information reported with
this option (see below).
.TP 10
.B \-g
Display times and dates in 
Greenwich Mean Time (\s-1GMT\s+1).
NB: \fIthis is the default\fP.
.TP 10
.BI \-h " host"
Report the status of the server on a specific
.IR host .
The
.I host
may be either a symbolic name or a network address.
If no
.B \-h
option is supplied,
.I faxstat
uses the
.SM FAXSERVER
environment variable to identify the \*(Fx server to contact.
If this variable is not set, then
.I faxstat
checks for a setting in the configuration files (first in the
per-user file and then in the system-wide file).
If all of the above fails, then
.I faxstat
attempts to contact a server on the machine where it is run.
.TP 10
.B \-i
Display additional status information for the server
as given by
.B ${SPOOL}/status/any.info.
This status typically has information such as the \*(Fx
version, the physical location of the server machine, and
an administrative contact for the server.  See \fIstatus\fP\|(${MANNUM4_5}).
.TP 10
.B \-l
Display times and dates in the local timezone of the server.
.TP 10
.B \-r
Display the receive queue status for each server.
The
.B RcvFmt
string defines the content and format of information reported with
this option (see below).
.TP 10
.B \-s
Display the status of jobs in the send queue on the server machine.
The
.B JobFmt
string defines the content and format of information reported with
this option (see below).
.TP 10
.B \-v
Trace the protocol exchanges between
.I faxstat
and the
.I hfaxd
processes on the standard output.
.SH "CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.I faxstat
reads configuration information from the file
.B ${LIBDATA}/hyla.conf
and then from the file
.BR ~/.hylarc .
Configuration files follow the conventions described in
.IR hylafax-client (1).
