faxsend \- \*(Fx facsimile transmit program

.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxsend
is the program that implements the facsimile transmission protocol
for the \*(Fx system.
.I faxsend
is invoked by the
.I faxq
scheduler process for each facsimile transmit attempt.
.I faxsend
assumes that its current working directory is the top of
the spooling hierarchy, that a suitable modem device
has been allocated for its use, and that all documents
to be sent are already converted to 
.SM TIFF/F
(\c
.SM TIFF
Class F) at the appropriate resolution and with an appropriate
data encoding.
In normal use
.I faxsend
will inherit a lockfile for the modem from the
.I faxq
process.
The format of the job description file specified on the
command line is described in
.IR sendq (${MANNUM4_5}).
.PP
.I faxsend
initializes the modem before attempting to transmit the facsimile
using the information in the appropriate modem configuration file.
If the modem does not respond to this initialization,
.I faxsend
will repeatedly try to initialize the modem.
This behaviour is required for send-only environments in which a
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8})
process is not run (and the modem would be known to be in a
properly initialized state).
.I faxsend
catches
.SM SIGINT
and
.SM SIGTERM
and cleans up any resources it controls; this is the mechanism
used by
.I faxq
to abort a job while it is in progress.
.PP
Multiple fax jobs of documents with varying formatting may be sent in
one fax call by ``batching'' them by supplying faxsend with multiple
.I qfile
entries.
.PP
Many aspects of
.I faxsend
operation are controlled through a configuration file.
The configuration file is located in the spooler hierarchy
in the
.B etc
subdirectory and is named
.BI config. device-ID ;
consult
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5})
for detailed information on the contents of configuration files.
.SH OPTIONS
The following options are recognized:
.TP 10
.BI \-c " config"
Treat
.I config
as a configuration parameter specification that is interpreted
after reading the per-device configuration file.
For example, ``-c sessiontracing:0x4f'' would set the
.B SessionTracing
configuration parameter to ``0x4f'', overriding any setting in
the configuration file.
.TP 10
.BI \-m " devID"
The device to use in processing the job.
Note that this is a \fIdevice identifier\fP and not the
pathname of the tty special file.
A device identifier is formed from a device filename by removing
any leading ``/dev/'' and converting any ``/'' characters to ``_''
characters.
.TP 10
.B \-l
Do the
.SM UUCP
lockfile protocol in
.IR faxsend .
By default
.I faxsend
assumes that it is invoked with the device already locked
and that it does not need to manage the lockfile.
.TP 10
.B \-p
Do not change the process priority when transmitting.
Normally
.I faxsend
will raise its priority to reduce i/o latency.
This option is useful for debugging.
.SH NOTES
.I faxsend
returns the new job status to
.I faxq
through the
.I returned
value in the associated qfile:
.I send_retry,
retry job;
.I send_failed,
job finished without success,
.I send_done,
job completed successfully,
.I send_reformat,
job should be retried after documents are reformatted.
