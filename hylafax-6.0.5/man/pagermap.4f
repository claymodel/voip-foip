.TH PAGERMAP ${MANNUM4_5} "May 8, 1996"
.SH NAME
pagermap \- \s-1SNPP\s+1 pager identifier mapping file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file
.B etc/pagermap
(by default) is used by the \s-1SNPP\s+1 support in
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8})
to map pager identifiers specified with the \s-1PAGE\s+1 directive
to
.SM IXO/TAP
or
.SM SMS
service providers and optionally a Pager Identification
Number (\s-1PIN\s+1).
(The ability to specify a \s-1PIN\s+1 makes it possible to define 
.I aliases
for pagers.)
Note that 
.B etc/pagermap
may be called a different name; the filename is specified
with the
.I PagerIDMapFile
configuration parameter read by
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8}).
.PP
The pagermap file is comprised of one or more
lines of the following format:
.sp
.nf
.RS
<\fIpattern\fP> <\fIdialstring\fP>[/<\fIpin\fP>]
.RE
.fi
.PP
Each line specifies a <\fIpattern\fP> that is matched against
a client-specified pager identifier string.
A pattern may be a plain string or a
.SM POSIX
1003.2 extended regular expression; plain strings
must compare exactly while regular expressions are unanchored and any
substring match constitutes a ``hit''.
Regular expressions are distinguished from plain strings by the
presence of one or more of the magic characters ``[]*.^$-+{}()''.
The <\fIdialstring\fP> identifies the
.SM IXO/TAP
or
.SM SMS
service provider to contact for delivery or, if <\fIdialstring\fP>
is the string ``reject'' (case insensitive) then the pager identifier
is rejected.
If the optional <\fIpin\fP> is specified then it used to deliver the
page instead of the client-specified identifier.
.PP
If the matching expression is a regular expression
the optional <\fIpin\fP\>
may reference the entire string matched by the
regular expression with the ``&'' character.
Substrings matched with the ``(...)'' constructs may be referenced
by using ``\e\fIn\fP'' where
.I n
is a single numeric digit between 1 and 9 that refers to the
.IR n -th
matched substring; c.f.
.IR re_format (7),
.IR sed (1),
etc.
.PP
.I hfaxd
processes lines in the mapping file sequentially; the first line
with a pattern that matches the pager identifier is used to deliver
or reject the page.
Lines that begin with a ``#'' are treated as comments and discarded.
Leading whitespace on a line is also ignored.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following defines an alias for ``sam'', submits all destinations
with a leading ``Sky'' to a particular
.SM IXO/TAP 
service provider, and otherwise rejects the pager ID.
(Note that using alphabetics in dial strings requires
a dialstring rules file that understands how to map alphabetics
to key codes\(emor one that passes them through verbatim.)
