.TH HOSTS.HFAXD ${MANNUM4_5} "January 18, 1996"
.SH NAME
hosts.hfaxd \- \*(Fx client access control list
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.SM ASCII
file
.B etc/hosts.hfaxd
in the \*(Fx spooling area specifies the
hosts and users that are permitted to access services through the
.IR hfaxd (${MANNUM1_8})
process.
This file must exist for client access; if it is not present then
.I hfaxd
will deny all requests for service.
Note also that this file must be readable only by the ``fax'' user; i.e.
it should have mode 600 and be owned by ``fax''.
.PP
Each newline-terminated entry is a set of colon (:) separated fields,
all but the first of which are optional.
Trailing null fields and their separators may be omitted.
The most general form is:
.sp
.ti +.5i
client:uid:passwd:adminwd
.sp
.I client
is a regular expression to be matched against a string
``\fIuser\fP@\fIhost\fP'' that is formed from the
.I user
string passed to
.I hfaxd
with the
.B USER
command and the official
.I host
name or the
.SM DARPA
Internet address, specified in ``dot notation''.
If
.I client
does not contain an ``@'' then, for backwards compatibility,
it is treated as a host for which any user may have access;
i.e. it is automatically converted to the regular expression
``^.*@\fIclient\fP$''.
.PP
Comments are introduced with the ``#'' character and extend
to the end of the line.
Any whitespace immediately preceding a comment is also ignored.
.PP
If 
.I client
has a leading ``!'', then it is interpreted as a class of
hosts and users to which access is to be
.BR disallowed .
That is, if the pattern matches the client information,
then access is denied.
.PP
Note that regular expressions are 
.B not
anchored.
That is, a regular expression may match a substring
of the ``\fIuser\fP@\fIhost\fP'' string.
Thus `\fIpb\fP@\fI.*\e.cl\e.cam\e.ac\e.uk\fP' matches
`\fIcpb\fP@\fImc.cl.cam.ac.uk.esd.sgi.com\fP'.
Use ``^'' to match the start of the string and ``$'' to
match the end.
.PP
Fields following 
.I client
are optional and specify the following:
.TP 10
.B uid
The numerical user ID to assign to clients that use the entry
for access.
.I hfaxd
uses the 
.I uid
to control access to server resources such as jobs and documents
(the value is used to set the group ID of files created by a client).
.IP
Multiple clients/users may share the same 
.I uid
or unique IDs may be created for each client.
User IDs may be any number in the range [0..60002]
with 60002 used, by convention, for entries that do not have a
.I uid
specified.
.TP 10
.B passwd
The encrypted password.
If this field is empty (null) then no password will be demanded when
a client logs in; i.e. the
.B USER
command does not need to be followed by a
.B PASS
command.
.TP 10
.B adminwd
The encrypted password for this user to gain administrative privileges.
If this field is empty (null) then the user is not permitted to have
administrative privileges.
.SH EXAMPLE
The following is a sample hosts.hfaxd file.
Note that the first entry that matches
is taken, so more-specific entries should be placed first.
