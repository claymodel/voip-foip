.TH FAXCRON ${MANNUM1_8} "May 12, 1996"
.SH NAME
faxcron \- \*(Fx routine maintenance script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/faxcron
[
.B \-n
] [
.B \-l
.I lastrun
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B faxcron
is a command script that does routine upkeep tasks in a \*(Fx
spooling directory hierarchy.
This script is intended to be invoked from
.IR cron (${MANNUM1_8})
on behalf of the fax user (often the ``fax'' user is uucp) once a day,
with the standard output sent by mail to the \*(Fx administrator.
For example, the following crontab might be set up for the fax user:
.sp .5
.nf
.ti +.2i
\fC25   23    *    *    *   sh ${SBIN}/faxcron | mail FaxMaster\fP
.fi
.PP
The
.I faxcron
script does the following work:
.IP \(bu 3
report statistics for facsimile transmitted since the last time 
.I faxcron
was run.
.IP \(bu 3
report statistics for facsimile transmitted in the past week.
.IP \(bu 3
report statistics for facsimile received since the last time
.I faxcron
was run.
.IP \(bu 3
report statistics for facsimile received in the past week.
.IP \(bu 3
report any recent calls that failed suspiciously and return the associated trace log;
.IP \(bu 3
purge data that is 30 days or older from the remote machine information directory;
.IP \(bu 3
delete information that is 30 days or older from session trace log files;
.IP \(bu 3
remove files from the tmp directory that are older than 1 day;
.IP \(bu 3
remove files in the received facsimile queue that are 7 days or older;
.IP \(bu 3
report sites that are currently having jobs rejected; and
.IP \(bu 3
force all session log files to be owned by the fax user
and kept with protection mode 644.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-n
Forces
.I faxcron
to run without updating any files.
.TP 10
.BI \-l " lastrun"
Forces the notion of the last time that
.I faxcron
was run to be 
.IR lastrun .
The value of 
.I lastrun
is a date and time string of the form ``MM/DD/YY HH:MM'' (the
.IR date (1)
format string ``%D %H:%M'').
.TP 10
.BI \-info " n"
Set the expiration time for data in the info database to be
.I n
days.
.TP 10
.BI \-log " n"
Set the expiration time for session log data to be
.I n
days.
.TP 10
.BI \-rcv " n"
Set the expiration time for files in the received facsimile queue to be
.I n
days.
.TP 10
.BI \-tmp " n"
Set the expiration time for files in the tmp directory to be
.I n
days.
.TP 10
.BI \-mode " m"
Set the file protection mode for session logs to 
.IR m
(a command line argument to 
.IR chmod (1)).
.SH NOTES
This script requires
.IR nawk (1)
or
.IR gawk (1)
and a
.I date (1)
program that supports the ``+format'' option.
.PP
If session logs are to be kept private this script must be modified
to filter out sensitive information such as calling card numbers.
(It should also be run with ``\-mode 0600'' so that
session log files are not publicly readable.)
