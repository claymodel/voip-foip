.SH NAME
mkcover \- \*(Fx continuation cover page generation command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SPOOL}/bin/mkcover
.I qfile
.I template
.I result
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bin/mkcover
is the command invoked by the facsimile server when a 
.I "continuation cover page"
is required for an outbound job that is about to be retried.
It generates a single \*(Ps\(rg page that is imaged according
to the remote capabilities and transmitted as the cover page.
The arguments are:
.TP 10
.B qfile
the job description file for the outbound job.
.TP
.B template
the cover page template file, as used by the
.IR faxcover (1)
program.
.TP
.B result
the filename where the resultant \*(Ps document
should be written.
.PP
The default
.I mkcover
command is a shell script that uses
.IR awk (1)
to parse the job description file and generate the cover page document.
The
.I template
file may be optionally compressed with
.IR compress (1),
.IR pack (1),
or
.IR gzip (1);
the filename suffix is used to decide whether or not the template
file contains compressed data.
