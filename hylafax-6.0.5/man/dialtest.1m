.TH DIALTEST ${MANNUM1_8} "March 3, 1995"
.SH NAME
dialtest \- \*(Fx dial string processing rules test program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/dialtest
[
.I options
]
.I dialrules
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dialtest
is an interactive program for the testing and development of
dial string processing rules used by \*(Fx.
.I dialtest
reads the file of rules specified on the command line
and then prompts for a dial string.
For each string typed in,
.I dialtest
prints the result of applying the canonicalization
and dial-string preparation rule sets.
A rule set whose name is
.I setname
can be specified by typing ``\fIsetname\fP(\fIstring\fP)'';
for example, ``\fICanonicalName\fP(+1.415.965.7824)''.
.PP
Note that
.I dialtest
reads the rules file only when it is initially started up.
This means that
.I dialtest
must be restarted for it to apply changes to a rules file.
.SH OPTIONS
