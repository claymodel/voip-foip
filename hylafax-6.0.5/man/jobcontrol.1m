.TH JOBCONTROL ${MANNUM1_8} "Mar 27, 2006"
.SH NAME
jobcontrols \- per-job controls for \*(Fx servers
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \*(Fx configuration parameter
.B JobControlCmd
specifies the script that is used to apply 
per-job controls on job characteristics
such as the time-of-day to place a call.
.PP
The controls program should produce a simple line-based
.SM ASCII
output containing a series of records of the form:
.sp .5
.RS
param: value
.RE
.sp .5
which is parsed the same manner as all HylaFAX config files.
Parameter values are parsed exactly as specified in
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5});
i.e. values with embedded whitespace may be enclosed in quote marks (``"'').
.PP
Comments are introduced with a ``#'' character and extend to the
end of the line.
.PP
The order of entries in the output is important.
The last parameter value overrides any previous values.
If the requested parameter is defined in the output, then the
last value is returned, otherwise a default value is used from the
.I faxq
configuration file.
.PP
The following parameters may be specified on a per-job basis;
consult
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5})
for a description of each parameter
(except
.B RejectNotice
which is described below).
.sp .5

.fi
.PP
The
.B Modem
parameter controls which
.B ModemGroup
is used in sending faxes to the destination.  If the user
assigns a
.B ModemGroup
for a specific job where all modems are outside of this
.B ModemGroup
matching a destination, then the value of
.B Modem
is overridden by the user's assignment.  Likewise, if the user
assigns a
.B ModemGroup
for a specific job where some, but not all, of the modems are
included in this
.B ModemGroup
matching a destination, then the value of
.B Modem
is overridden by the inclusive set of modems found in both.
.PP
The
.B RejectNotice
parameter controls whether or not to reject
jobs to the destination.
Jobs that are
rejected are done so
without placing a phone call and the associated message
is returned to the job submitter.
This facility can be used to disallow calling sensitive
phone numbers; for example
.sp .5
.nf
.ft C
    RejectNotice: "Calls to emergency numbers are not permitted"
.ft P
.fi
.PP
The
.B VRes
parameter controls the vertical resolution. Possible values are 98 (normal resolution, equivalent to
.I sendfax
-l option) and 196 (fine resolution, equivalent to
.I sendfax
-m option).
.PP
The
.B UseXVRes
parameter is used to enable or disable the usage of extended resolutions supported by the receiver. Possible values are 1 (enable extended resolutions usage, equivalent to
.I sendfax
-G option) and 0 (disable extended resolutions usage).
This parameter supersedes the usage of
.B VRes.
.PP
In addition to the above parameters, any other parameters that are specified
are automatically accumulated and passed to programs invoked by
.IR faxq ,
such as
.I faxsend
and
.IR pagesend .
This is a convenient mechanism for defining configuration parameters
for all modems without having to modify each modem-specific configuration
file.  For example,
.sp .5
.nf
.ft C
    SessionTracing: 0x4f
.ft P
.fi
.PP
This mechanism also makes it easy to control transmit-related parameters
according to the destination phone number.  For example, to disable use
of 
.SM ECM
and restrict the transmit speed when placing
international phone calls one might use:
.sp .5
.nf
.ft C
    DesiredBR: 3
    DesiredEC: 0
    DesiredDF: 1
.ft P
