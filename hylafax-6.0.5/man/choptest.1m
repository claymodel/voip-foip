.TH CHOPTEST ${MANNUM1_8} "October 3, 1995"
.SH NAME
choptest \- \*(Fx page chopping test program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/choptest
[
.I options
] input.tif
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I choptest
is a program for testing the page chopping support in
the \*(Fx software (specifically, in the
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8})
program).
.I choptest
analyzes a
.SM TIFF/F
(\c
.SM TIFF
Class F) file with 1-D MH- or 2-D MR-encoded data and
reports what the automatic page chopping logic would do
if the file were submitted for transmission.
Options are provided for controlling 
whether
.I choptest
checks the last page or all pages of the document, and
what whitespace threshold to use in deciding if a page
should be chopped.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-a
Chop all pages in the document.
This is equivalent to setting the
.B PageChop
configuration parameter to ``all''; c.f.
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
By default only the last page of the document is considered.
.TP
.BI \-t " inches"
Set the minimum whitespace threshold that must be present on
a page for it to be chopped.
This is equivalent to the
.B PageChopThreshold
configuration parameter; c.f.
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
By default 
.I choptest
requires that at least 3 inches of trailing whitespace be present.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following shows a multi-page, high-resolution document.
Each page has insufficient whitespace for it to be chopped.
.PP
.nf
hyla% ./choptest -a ~/tiff/pics/faxix.tif
Chop pages with >=3" of white space at the bottom.
Don't chop, found 67 rows, need 588 rows
