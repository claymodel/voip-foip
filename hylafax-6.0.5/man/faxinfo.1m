This information is typically included in the notification
mail generated by the
.IR faxrcvd (${MANNUM1_8})
script when a facsimile is received by \*(Fx.
.PP
.TP
.B \-n
suppresses the printing of the filename.
.TP
.B \-b
strips any leading directory of the filename before printing
.TP
.B \-D
prints the actual print strings being used for debug purposes
.PP

.nf
\-S '' \-s '' \-e '\n' \-E ''

.PP
Raw formating:
.TP
.B \-S fmt
used to start each fax, it is passed one parameter, the fax file name
.TP
.B \-s fmt

.TP
.B \-e fmt
used to end each field, it is passed one parameter, the field name
.TP
.B \-E fmt
used to end each fax, it is passed one parameter, the fax file name
.SH NOTES
The information that
.I faxinfo
prints is obtained from the tags stored in the
.SM TIFF
image that is written by the \*(Fx software.
If 
.I faxinfo
is presented with an invalid 
.SM TIFF
image it may print uninteresting information.
Similarly if a
.SM TIFF
image that was not written by \*(Fx is supplied as an argument
then only partial information may be printed\(emthis is
because \*(Fx stores certain information in private tags that
other 
.SM TIFF
writers may not emit.
.PP
Use of the raw 
.I fmt
options to allow you to directly control the print format
strings used when formating the output.  These format strings are passed directly
to printf, with basic \\<char> sequences being interpreted, including \\n, \\r, 
and \\t, and can be used to make the faxinfo output conform to specific requirements,
like peculiar CVS, tables, HTML, etc.
.PP
The order of the options is important.  They are parsed from first to last, so any
later options will override settings of previous ones.
.SH ERRORS
.I faxinfo
return
.B 0
on success and
.B 1
if the file passed as argument is not valid.
