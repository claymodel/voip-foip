.TH TSITEST ${MANNUM1_8} "March 3, 1995"
.SH NAME
tsitest \- \*(Fx
.SM TSI
access control list checking program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/tsitest
[
.B \-q
]
.I ACLfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I tsitest
is an interactive program for the testing of the
.SM TSI
access control list (\c
.SM ACL\c
) used by the 
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8})
server processes to screen incoming facsimile.
The 
.I ACLfile
specified on the command line is expected to contain 
.SM TSI
control expressions as described in
.IR tsi (${MANNUM4_5}).
Strings typed at the prompt are then checked against the list
and
.I tsitest
prints out whether or not the string is an acceptable
.SM TSI.
.PP
Note that
.I tsitest
reads the control list file only when it is initially started up.
This means that
.I tsitest
must be restarted for it to recognize changes to
.IR ACLfile .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-q
Operate \fIquietly\fP;
.I tsitest
will print only whether an input string is accepted or rejected.
