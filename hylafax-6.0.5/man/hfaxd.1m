.SH DESCRIPTION
.I hfaxd
is the \*(Fx program that implements the server
portion of:
.IP \(bu 3
the client-server protocol and
.IP \(bu 3
the Simple Network Paging Protocol (\s-1SNPP\s+1) used to submit
message pager jobs to the IXO/TAP and UCP support.
.PP
Additional client-server protocols are planned and 
.I hfaxd
is intended to be the ``carrier'' through which they are supported.
.PP
.I hfaxd
is typically used in one of two ways; either as a standalone
process that is started at system boot time to listen
for client connections on one or more ports (in which case the
-i, -o, or -s option must be used),
or as a subservient process to the
.IR inetd (${MANNUM1_8})
program.
The two forms of use may however be combined so long as the same
service is not provided both by the standalone
.I hfaxd
and through
.IR inetd .
.SH "HYLAFAX (NEW) CLIENT-SERVER PROTOCOL SUPPORT"
If
.I hfaxd
is started with the
.B \-i
option it will service clients using the \*(Fx client-server
protocol.
This protocol is strongly related to the Internet File Transfer
Protocol (\s-1FTP\s+1); so much so in fact that \s-1FTP\s+1
client programs that include support for ``quoted commands''
may be used to communicate with
.I hfaxd
using the new protocol.
(It should also be possible to use \s-1FTP\s+1-aware World Wide
Web browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape Navigator to access \*(Fx
servers through the new protocol; but the current format for
information returned in directory listings confuses them.)
.PP
The
.I hfaxd
server currently recognizes the following protocol requests; case
is not distinguished.
Entries marked with a \(S1 can be used only when the client has
established administrative privileges with \s-1ADMIN\s+1.

.PP
The 
.I hfaxd
server will abort an active data transfer only when the
\s-1ABOR\s+1 command is preceded by a Telnet "Interrupt Process" (IP)
signal and a Telnet "Synch" signal in the command Telnet stream,
as described in Internet \s-1RFC\s+1 959.
If a \s-1STAT\s+1 command is received during a data transfer,
preceded by a Telnet IP and Synch, transfer status will be returned.
.SH "SIMPLE NETWORK PAGING PROTOCOL (SNPP) SUPPORT"
If
.I hfaxd
is started with the
.B \-s
option it will service clients using the Simple Network Pager
Protocol (\s-1SNPP\s+1) as specified in \s-1RFC\s+1 1861
(which obsoletes
.SM RFC
1645).
.PP
The
.I hfaxd
server currently recognizes the \s-1SNPP\s+1
protocol requests listed below.
Requests marked with a \(S1 are non-standard extensions to
.SM RFC
1861 that may be added to
.SM SNPP
at some future time.

.PP
Note that
.I hfaxd
requires that
.SM SNPP
clients login first with the
.SM LOGI
directive while
.SM RFC
1861 permits clients to submit pages anonymously.
.SH "CLIENT ACCESS CONTROL"
.I hfaxd
controls client access according to the information in the file
.BR ${SPOOL}/etc/hosts.hfaxd .
This file defines the set of users and machines that may receive
service and, optionally, defines password challenges to use in
authenticating clients.
Clients may be permitted access to services with or without a password
challenge.
Access may also be restricted based on the host machine that a
request for service originates from.
Consult
.IR hosts.hfaxd (${MANNUM4_5})
for information on the format and content of this file.
The \s-1SITE ADDUSER\s+1
protocol request is provided for adding new users to a server
(available only to clients with administrative privileges).
.PP
Server resources are controlled based on clients' identities.
Jobs and documents, both received and submitted, are protected
by the server.
Typically clients are permitted access to anything they own or
that is publicly accessible.
There are also administrative privileges that clients may acquire
and which permit them wide access to objects that reside on the
server.
.PP
A complete client-server protocol specification is still outstanding.
.PP
.I hfaxd
operates with its root directory set to the top of the
\*(Fx spooling area; ${SPOOL}.
This is done so that clients see a virtual file hierarchy that
is completely contained within the \*(Fx operating environment on
the server machine.
Administrators however must be aware of this action when specifying
files in the
.I hfaxd
configuration file: absolute pathnames relative to the root of the 
spooling should be used to specify filenames.
.SH "SERVER ACCESS CONTROL"
The file
.BR ${SPOOL}/etc/shutdown ,
when present, specifies when to restrict access to a server machine.
When this file is present and contains valid information
.I hfaxd
will permit only users with administrative privileges to access
the server.
Any other users that request service will be denied access and
negative server responses will include any
shutdown message specified in the shutdown file.
Consult
.IR hylafax-shutdown (${MANNUM4_5})
for information on the format and content of this file.
.PP
The \s-1SHUT\s+1
protocol request can be used to schedule a server shutdown;
it is available only to clients with administrative privileges.
To make a shutdown server available again the shutdown file
can be deleted with the \s-1DELE\s+1
protocol request (\fIthis is to be replaced with an ``unshut''
protocol request so that implementation details are not part of the
protocol\fP).
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILES"
.I hfaxd
reads configuration information from the file
.BR ${LIBDATA}/hfaxd.conf
each time a new server process is started (i.e. for each new client).
This file uses the same conventions used by other \*(Fx configuration
files; as described in 
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
The following configuration parameters are recognized; items marked
``(\s-1SNPP\s+1)'' are used only by the \s-1SNPP\s+1 support.

.PP
The configuration parameters are explained below:
.TP 10
.B AllowSortFormat
This controls whether the server accept the *SORTFMT commands which the client
issues to change the server sort the listings.
.TP 10
.B FaxContact
The e-mail address to display as a point of contact in the help text
returned to a client in response to the \s-1HELP\s+1 or
\s-1SITE HELP\s+1 commands.
By default this is ``FaxMaster@\fIhostname\fP'', where
.I hostname
is the fully qualified name for the machine where the server is running.
.TP 10
.B FileFmt
The format string to use when returning file status information with the
\s-1LIST\s+1 and \s-1STAT\s+1 commands.
Formats are specified using 
.IR printf (3S)
style conventions but using the field identifiers listed below.
Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification,
0-filling, etc. just as for 
.IR printf ;
e.g. %-8p for an 8-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded
field containing the file protection flags.
.IP

.IP
The default format string is ``%-7p %3l %8o %8s %-12.12m %.48f''.
It is recommended that all items include a field width so that client
applications
that construct headers from the format string can constrain the width of
column title strings.
.TP 10
.B FileSortFmt
The format string to use when sorting the listing for directories using the
LIST command.  Follows the FileFmt formatting rules.
.TP 10
.B IdleTimeout
The initial/default timeout to use in timing out idle clients.
This value defines the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that
.I hfaxd
will wait for a command from a client before terminating the connection.
Unprivileged clients may alter the idle timeout up to the value of
.IR MaxIdleTimeout ;
privileged clients may set the timeout to any value.
.TP 10
.B JobFmt
The format string to use when returning job status information for
jobs in the 
.B sendq
and
.B doneq
directories.
Formats are specified using 
.IR printf (3S)
style conventions but using the field identifiers listed below.
Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification,
0-filling, etc. just as for 
.IR printf ;

.fi
.IP
The default format string is ``%\-4j %3i %1a %6.6o %\-12.12e %5P %5D %7z %.25s''.
This string constrains each status line to be less than 80 characters.
It is recommended that all items include a field width so that client
applications, such as
.IR faxstat (1)
that construct headers from the format string can constrain the width of
column title strings.
.TP 10
.B JobSortFmt
The format string to use when sorting the listing for jobs in the
sendq and doneq directories.  Follows the JobFmt formatting rules.
.TP 10
.B JobProtection
The file mode setting for job qfiles in the \*(Fx queues (sendq and doneq).
The default setting of ``0644'' allows all users to view all job parameters in
the send/done queues.  If
.IR PublicJobQ
is set to false, then this file mode determines the permissions of the clients to
see the jobs, following the \*(Fx permission model of the group bits
controlling uid permissions and the other bits controlling other permissions.
.TP 10
.B KillTimeMap
The mapping from \s-1SNPP\s+1 service level (0-11) to job expiration time
(kill time).
A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each
value is the number of minutes to permit a job to run.
The default mapping is ``5 5 5 15 60 240 720 1440 1440 1440 1440 1440''
which expires a
job in 5 minutes for service levels 0-2, 15 minutes for level three, 60
minutes for level four, etc.
.TP 10
.B LogFacility
The symbolic name for the 
.IR syslog (3)
facility to use when logging error messages and
informational/debugging messages requested through the
.B ServerTracing
parameter.
The list of facility names is found in the system include file
.BR <syslog.h> ;
comparisons are case-insensitive.
.TP 10
.B MaxAdminAttempts
The maximum number of unsuccessful attempts
gain administrative privileges with the \s-1ADMIN\s+1 command that
.I hfaxd
will permit a client before terminating the connection.
Note that the count of attempts is reset if/when the client
successfully gains administrative privileges.
.TP 10
.B MaxConsecutiveBadCmds
The maximum number of consecutive unrecognized, unimplemented, syntactically
incorrect, or otherwise unacceptable commands to permit a client
before terminating the connection.
This control has two purposes: to handle naive or malicious clients
from sending long streams of nonsense commands to a server, and to
insure that clients are forcibly terminated when a server is marked shutdown.
.TP 10
.B MaxIdleTimeout
The maximum value that a client may set the idle timeout to.
This value is not enforced if the client has administrative privileges.
.TP 10
.B MaxLoginAttempts
The maximum number of unsuccessful attempts
to login with the \s-1USER\s+1 and \s-1PASS\s+1 commands that
.I hfaxd
will permit a client before terminating the connection.
.TP 10
.B MaxMsgLength
The maximum number of characters to accept in a pager message specified
with the \s-1DATA\s+1 or \s-1MESS\s+1 commands.
Messages longer than this value are rejected.
.TP 10
.B ModemFmt
The format string to use when returning modem status information
for modems listed in the 
.B status
directory.
Formats are specified using 
.IR printf (3S)
style conventions but using the field identifiers listed below.
Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification,
0-filling, etc. just as for 
.IR printf ;
e.g. %-8h for an 8-character wide, left-justified, blank-padded
field containing the name of the host the server is running on.

v	Modem speaker volume as one-character symbol
z	A ``*'' if a \fIfaxgetty\fP\|(${MANNUM1_8}) process is running; otherwise `` '' (space)
.fi
.IP
The default format string is ``Modem %m (%n): %s''.
.TP 10
.B ModemSortFmt
The format string to use when sorting the listsin for  modem status information
in the status directory.
.TP 10
.B PagerIDMapFile
The absolute pathname of the file that contains directions for
mapping pager identifiers to \s-1IXO/TAP\s+1 or \s-1UCP\s+1 service providers
(and optionally a pager identification number).
Consult
.IR pagermap (${MANNUM4_5})
for information on the format and content of this file.
(Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root
of the spooling area).
.TP 10
.B PriorityMap
The mapping from \s-1SNPP\s+1 service level (0-11) to job scheduling priority.
A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each
value is the priority to assign to a job.
The default mapping is ``63 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127 127''
which assigns
a high priority to service level zero and normal (default) priority to
all other service levels.
.TP 10
.B PublicJobQ
By default, HylaFAX has always made the listings of the sendq/doneq include all
jobs to any client connected to hfaxd.  By setting this to false, hfaxd will
also enforce it's normal access restrictions on the listing of jobs in the
sendq/doneq.  These access restrictions are based on the file mode (see
.IR JobProtection
) and the logged in uid (see
.IR hosts.hfaxd
)
.TP 10
.B PublicRecvQ
By default, HylaFAX has always made the listings of the recvq include all
faxes to any client connected to hfaxd.  By setting this to false, hfaxd will
also enforce it's normal access restrictions on the listing of faxes in the
recvq.  These access restrictions are based on the file mode
.IR faxgetty
(and it's related
.IR FaxDispatch
) set for the fax, and the logged in uid (see
.IR hosts.hfaxd
)
.TP 10
.TP 10
.B RcvFmt
The format string to use when returning status information for
received facsimile in the 
.B recvq
directory.
Formats are specified using 
.IR printf (3S)
style conventions but using the field identifiers listed below.
Each item can include field width, precision, left-justification,

The default format string is ``%\-7m %4p%1z %\-8.8o %14.14s %7t %f''.
This string constrains each status line to be less than 80 characters.
It is recommended that all items include a field width so that client
applications, such as
.IR faxstat (1)
that construct headers from the format string can constrain the width of
column title strings.
.TP 10
.B RcvSortFmt
The format string to use when sorting the listing for received facsimile in the
recvq directory.  Follows the RcvFmt formatting rules.
.TP 10
.B RetryTimeMap
The mapping from \s-1SNPP\s+1 service level (0-11) to job retry time.
A mapping is specified as a string of space-separate numbers where each
value is the number of seconds to delay between delivery attempts.
A value of zero causes retries to be scheduled using the default
algorithm used by the \*(Fx job scheduler.
The default mapping is
``30 60 60 180 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0''
which retries a level 0 job after a 30 second delay, levels 1 and 2
after 60 seconds, level 3 after 3 minutes, and other jobs are
retried according to the usual scheduling algorithm.
.TP 10
.B ServerTracing
A number that controls the generation of tracing
information by a server.
.I areas
that are individually controlled.
To enable tracing of multiple areas of operation, the
flag associated with each area should be bit-or'd to
form the value for this tag.

Tracing messages are directed to
.IR syslog (3)
using the \fIfacility\fP specified with the
.B LogFacility
configuration parameter.
Note that 
.IR syslogd (${MANNUM1_8})
must be configured to capture
.IR facility.info ,
.IR facility.debug ,
.IR facility.warning ,
and
.I facility.err
messages.
.TP 10
.B ShutdownFile
The absolute pathname of the server shutdown file;
see
.IR hylafax-shutdown (${MANNUM4_5})
for information on the format and content of this file.
(Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root
of the spooling area).
.TP 10
.B UserAccessFile
The absolute pathname of the user access control file;
see
.IR hosts.hfaxd (${MANNUM4_5})
for information on the format and content of this file.
(Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root
of the spooling area).
.TP 10
.B XferLogFile
The absolute pathname of the file to use for logging client-server
file transfers (when enabled through the
.B ServerTracing
parameter).
(Note that absolute pathnames are relative to the root
of the spooling area).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.BI \-q " dir"
The specified directory is treated as the spooling area.
The default spooling area,
.IR ${SPOOL} ,
is defined at the time the software is built.
.TP 10
.B \-d
Stop
.I hfaxd
from
.I detaching
itself from the controlling terminal.
This option is normally used only when running 
.I hfaxd
under a debugger or when
.I hfaxd
is started up from the
.IR inetd (${MANNUM1_8})
process.
.TP 10
.BI \-l " bindaddress"
Bind to the specified 
.I bindaddress
the tcp port. Please note that this argument need to be specified before
the 
.BI \-i
otherwise it will be ignored. A better approach to improve security would
be to run hfaxd from xinetd, binding its service to the specific port. This
will also make hylafax benefits from tcp wrappers and other options
provided by xinetd.
.TP 10
.BI \-i " port"
Listen on the specified 
.I port
for service requests and respond with the client-server protocol.
The port may be specified either symbolically, e.g. ``hylafax''
or numerically.
This flag may be specified multiple times to request service on multiple
different ports.  Each time this flag is specified, it will listen on the
specified port, bound to the last
.BI \-l " bindaddress"
specified.  If no
.BI \-l " bindaddress"
was specified, it will bind to the system configured default wildcard
address, which could be any of IPv6, or IPv4, or both.
.TP 10
.BI \-s " port"
Listen on the specified
.I port
for service requests and respond with the Simple Network Paging (SNPP)
protocol.
The port may be specified either symbolically, e.g. ``snpp''
or numerically.
This flag may be specified multiple times to request service on multiple
different ports.
.TP 10
.B \-I
Service the client-server protocol using the standard input and
output.
This option is useful when
.I hfaxd
is started up by
.IR inetd (${MANNUM1_8}).
.TP 10
.B \-S
Service the Simple Network Paging (SNPP) protocol
using the standard input and output.
This option is useful when
.I hfaxd
is started up by
.IR inetd (${MANNUM1_8}).
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Diagnostics generated by
.I hfaxd
are logged using
.IR syslog (3).
