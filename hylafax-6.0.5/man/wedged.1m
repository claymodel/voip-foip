.TH WEDGED ${MANNUM1_8} "October 3, 1995"
.SH NAME
wedged \- \*(Fx modem wedged script
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SPOOL}/bin/wedged
.I devid
.I device
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B bin/wedged
is the command script invoked by the facsimile server when a modem
is deemed to be in an irreparable state and requires operator intervention.
This decision is based on the setting of the
.B MaxSetupAttempts
configuration parameter described in
.IR hylafax-config (${MANNUM4_5}).
The default
.I wedged
script sends electronic mail to the FaxMaster alias. The interval at which
emails are sent can be configured in the
.B etc/FaxDispatch
file by setting the WEDGED_EMAIL_INTERVAL variable to the desired number
of minutes (emails will be sent no more than every WEDGED_EMAIL_INTERVAL
minutes, until the wedged condition persists).
If the variable WEDGED_DISABLE_FAXGETTY is set in
.B etc/FaxDispatch
then the script will attempt to disable any faxgetty processes spawned by the
.IR init (${MANNUM1_8})
process for the problematic modem.
In addition the
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8})
process automatically disables use of the modem for servicing
outbound jobs.
.P
The
.I devid
argument is the identifier derived from the name of the modem's
device file by substituting ``_'' characters for ``/'' characters;
e.g.
.I term_10
for
.IR /dev/term/10 .
The
.I device
argument is the name of the character special device
associated with the modem.
.P
If there exists an executable file 
.B ${SPOOL}/etc/resetmodem
then that file will be executed upon execution of
the
.I wedged
script in an effort to recover the modem.
