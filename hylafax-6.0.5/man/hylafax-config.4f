.SH NAME
config \- \*(Fx configuration database
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*(Fx uses a configuration file for the central queueing
agent and for each facsimile modem attached
to a machine.
These files contain information about the modems and about how
the \*(Fx server processes that service these modem should operate.
Configuration files are located in the
.B etc
subdirectory.
The configuration file for the 
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8})
program is named
.BR config .
The per-modem configuration files used by the
.IR faxgetty (${MANNUM1_8}),
.IR faxsend (${MANNUM1_8}),
and
.IR pagesend (${MANNUM1_8})
programs have names of the form
.BI config. devid ,
where
.I devid
is an identifier derived from the name of
the modem's device file; for example
.I ttym2
for
.IR /dev/ttym2 ,
.I term_10
for
.IR /dev/term/10 .
.PP
Configuration files have a simple format and are entirely
.SM ASCII.
A configuration parameter is of the form
.sp .5
.ti +0.5i
\fBtag\fP: \fIvalue\fP
.br
.sp .5
where a \fItag\fP identifies a parameter and a \fIvalue\fP
is either a string, number, or boolean value.
Comments are introduced by the ``#'' character
and extend to the end of the line.
String values start at the first non-blank character
after the ``:'' and continue to the first non-whitespace
character or, if whitespace is to be included, may be
enclosed in quote marks (``"'').
String values enclosed in quote marks may also use the
standard C programming conventions for specifying escape
codes; e.g. ``\en'' for a newline character and ``\exxx''
for an octal value.
Numeric values are specified according to the C programming
conventions (leading ``0x'' for hex, leading ``0'' for octal, otherwise
decimal), except for a few parameters, such as
.BR RecvFileMode ,
whose value is interpreted strictly as an octal number
and
.BR PageChopThreshold
whose value is interpreted strictly as a floating point number.
Boolean values are case insensitive.
For a true value, either ``Yes'' or ``On'' should
be used.
For a false value, use ``No'' or ``Off''.
.PP
The following table itemizes the tags and the expected type
of their value.
The first part lists items specific to the operation of each
server, while the second part has items related to the
servicing of the modem.
Parameters marked with a \(S1 are used only
by the \*(Fx scheduler process and should appear only in the file named
.BR config .
Parameters marked with a \(S2 are used by both the scheduler and
the per-device applications and so should appear in all appropriate
configuration files (i.e. 
.B config
and any per-device files that make sense).
Parameters not otherwise marked should appear only in per-device
configuration files.
More detailed information about each item is given following the table.

.SH "SERVER-ORIENTED CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
These configuration parameters affect the general
operation of the fax server.
.TP
.B AdaptiveAnswer
Control whether or not an adaptive answering
strategy is used whereby an incoming call is
answered in multiple ways according to the list specified in the
.B AnswerRotary
parameter.
For example, if adaptive answering is enabled and
.B AnswerRotary
specifies ``fax data'', then an incoming call will
first be answered as fax using
.B ModemAnswerFaxCmd
and then, if that fails, as data using
.BR ModemAnswerDataCmd .
If the adaptive answer strategy is not enabled, then calls
are answered using the appropriate
.B ModemAnswer*Cmd
parameter (normally
.B ModemAnswerCmd
for unattended operation).
Note that the adaptive answer strategy depends on many factors
that limit its usefulness.
When calls are answered first as fax,
it typically only works with a Class 1 modem because it is
important that the sequence of operations related to answering
as fax be completed in a short enough time that a subsequent
answer for data be done before the caller times out and hangs
up the telephone
(for this reason
.B Class1RecvIdentTimer
should be set to a value that is shorter than
.BR FaxT1Timer .)
Also, note that it is sometimes necessary to arrange that the phone be
placed on-hook between successive answers; this can typically be
done by inserting the appropriate command at the start of the
second and subsequent
.BR ModemAnswer*Cmd s.
.TP
.B AdminGroup
Tells PAM what user group is allowed to administer the fax server.
Only useful if the server is compiled with PAM enabled.
.TP
.B AnswerRotary
The sequence of answering techniques the server should
``rotate through'' when answer incoming calls.
Answering techniques are:
.sp .5
.ta \w'\fBName\fP    'u
.nf
\fBName	Description\fP
fax	answer a fax call
data	answer a data call
voice	answer a voice call
extern	use the \fIvgetty\fP application to answer a call
any	answer a call of any/unknown type
.fi
.sp .5
When a call is not answered successfully, the server
advances the rotary to the next specified answering
technique.
If
.B AdaptiveAnswer
is enabled, the server will try all the answering techniques for
each incoming call.
Otherwise, the rotary is advanced
.I between
unsuccessful phone calls.
For example, if
.B AdaptiveAnswer
is disabled and
.B AnswerRotary
is ``fax data'',
then the calls will initially be answered as fax until
the first call is received that does not appear to be
from a fax machine; after that calls will be answered
as if they were from a data modem until the next unsuccessful
call; after which they will one again be answered as fax. 
Only the first three techniques listed are used; any additional
ones are (silently) ignored.
See also
.BR AnswerBias .
.TP
.B AnswerBias
The index into the
.B AnswerRotary
list that the server should rotate the list to after
each successful incoming phone call.
List indices are numbered starting at zero.
For example, if
.B AnswerRotary
is ``fax data'' and
.B AnswerBias
is 1, then after each successful inbound call, the
next call will be answered as data.
.TP
.B AreaCode\(S2
The local area code in which the facsimile modem resides.
This value is passed to the dial string rules that are
used, for example,
to formulate canonical phone numbers for dialing (see
.B DialStringRules
below.)
.TP
.B AuditHook\(S1
Specifies a program command and an interest specification indicating which events as
described in 
.IR faxwatch (${MANNUM1_8})
should trigger the execution of the program.  For example, this configuration:
.nf

    AuditHook: "bin/hook: J*S*M*R*"

.fi
would cause bin/hook to be executed upon every event.  The arguments passed to the 
hook program are respectively
.IR <class> ,
.IR <mask> ,
.IR <id> ,
and optionally
.IR [info]
where...
.nf

    <class> = JOB | SEND | MODEM | RECV
    <mask>  = the specific event
    <id>    = id of the job/modem with which the event is associated
    [info]  = additional information

.fi
.TP
.B BadPageHandlingMethod
(Class 1/1.0 only) Specifies how to react to a bad page received from the remote sender:
one of ``\s-1RTN\s+1'', ``\s-1DCN\s+1'', or ``\s-1RTN-SAVE\s+1''.

If a page is received in non-ECM mode with unacceptable quality 
according to
.BR PercentGoodLines
or
.BR MaxConseutiveBadLines
then it can be somewhat difficult to inform the sender of the problem.
Historically, \*(Fx has assumed that signalling RTN to the sender will
accomplish this.  However, some senders are incapable of retransmitting
pages, and to reduce burden they treat an RTN signal as a receipt 
confirmation and proceed to the next page without notifying the sending
user of the potential problem in readability on the receive-end.  (The
assumption there being that the receiving user will notify the sending
user if there actually is a readability problem.)

A setting of ``\s-1RTN\s+1'' is the historic behavior and assumes that 
an RTN signal will be enough to get the sender to retransmit or be
otherwise informed of a potential readability problem on the receive-end.
The previously-received page data is marked to be overwritten by the next page
data received from the sender.

A setting of ``\s-1DCN\s+1'' tells \*(Fx to transmit a DCN signal in 
response to the post-page message and should trigger a call abortion by
the sender.  This should clearly indicate a problem in page readability
to the sender, although the receipt of any following pages in a later
call cannot be guaranteed.

A setting of ``\s-1RTN-SAVE\s+1'' more closely approximates the behavior
of other fax receivers (especially fax machines).  It causes \*(Fx to
send the RTN signal but it saves the previously received page data and places
the next transmitted page data in another page.  This is the default
setting.  However, this could result in multiple copies of the same page
image being saved in the same file - if the sender does indeed retransmit
the unacceptable pages during the same call.
.TP
.B BatchLogs\(S1
When sending or receiving multiple documents (denoted by EOM), this
value determines if the session logs span the entire batch or, if set
to no, only contain a single document.
.TP
.B CallIDPattern
A string that identifies the caller's identity in any call
identification messages provided by the modem (such as Caller*ID or DNIS/DID).
The specified string is compared against any
unrecognized status messages received from the modem before
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is sent to the modem.
If there is a match, then the remainder
of the message is returned as
.B CallIDn
where n corresponds to the n'th instance that this
.B CallIDPattern
is from the top in the modem configuration file.
For example, for the ZyXEL U-1496 this parameter would be set to
.nf
\s-1CallIDPattern: ``CALLER NAME: ''\s+1 (note the trailing space).
.fi
If more than one message matches between instances of "RING" messages, then the message remainders are 
concatenated.

The special
.B CallID
value of "SHIELDED_DTMF" is used in conjunction with
.B ModemRingResponse
and
.B CallIDAnswerLength.
After executing
.B ModemRingResponse,
HylaFAX will expect
DTMF data (usually DLE-shielded) for
.B CallIDn
until
.B CallIDAnswerLength
is reached.  Note that if the modem is in voice mode to hear these
DTMF digits, then it must be returned to fax mode in the
.B ModemAnswerCmd.
In order to prevent this feature from losing incoming fax calls, if
fax sender CNG is detected while waiting for DTMF or if ten seconds
elapse without sufficient DTMF then the remaining expected digits
will be populated by whitespace, triggering fax answering.

For example, the following settings will cause HylaFAX to enter
voice mode and go off-hook when a RING is detected.  It will then
expect four DTMF digits (presumably for routing), and then it will
pause for 100 ms before returning to fax mode and answering the call.
.nf

  ModemRingResponse:     AT+FCLASS=8;H1
  CallIDPattern:         SHIELDED_DTMF
  CallIDAnswerLength:    4
  ModemAnswerCmd:        <delay:100>AT+FCLASS=1;A

.fi
For modems that do not support AT+FCLASS=8 (such as some USR modems) this
may be an appropriate equivalent:
.nf

  ModemRingResponse:      "AT#CLS=8\\nAT#VLS=4\\nATA"
  CallIDPattern:          SHIELDED_DTMF
  CallIDAnswerLength:     4
  ModemAnswerCmd:         "<delay:100>AT+FCLASS=1\\nATA"

.fi
Multiple entries of
.B CallIDPattern
are used together in one modem configuration file in order to capture multiple
.B CallID
responses.  For example, the following settings would capture "NDID" responses
from the modem as CallID1, "NMBR" responses from the modem as CallID2, "NAME"
responses as CallID3, and it would trigger
.B ModemAnswerCmd
whenever CallID1 or CallID2 were longer than 7 or 10 characters, respectively.
.nf

  CallIDPattern:         "NDID="
  CallIDAnswerLength:    7
  CallIDPattern:         "NMBR="
  CallIDAnswerLength:    10
  CallIDPattern:         "NAME="

.fi
Note that this example is only given as an example, and probably would cause unexpected
results.  Because pattern-matching ends when
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is sent to the modem, if "NDID", "NMBR", and "NAME" responses came from the modem in
that order, and the "NDID" response was at least 7 characters long, then
.B ModemAnswerCmd
would be sent to the modem immediately following the "NDID" response, and the "NMBR" and
"NAME" responses would be ignored.  Generally only one
.B CallIDAnswerLength
item should be in a modem configuration file.
.TP
.B CallIDAnswerLength
An integer indicating the minimum number of characters in a
.B CallID
matching the previous
.B CallIDPattern
to be received when
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is sent to the modem irrespective of any
.B RingsBeforeAnswer
value greater than zero.  This allows the answering of calls
which deliver CID/DID data but not RINGs.
For example,
.nf
\s-1CallIDAnswerLength: ``7''\s+1
.fi
would cause the call to be answered
when
.B CallID2
reached a length of seven digits.
A value of zero for
.B CallIDAnswerLength
disables this feature.
.TP
.B ClocalAsRoot
Control whether operations that set the
.SM CLOCAL
bit on the modem device special file are done with the effective
user-ID set to the super-user or the ``fax'' user.
By default such operations are done as the fax user, except under
.SM IRIX
where they are done as the super-user
(because 
.SM IRIX
disallows manipulation of
.SM CLOCAL
by anyone but the super-user).
.TP
.B ContCoverCmd\(S1
The command to invoke to generate a continuation cover page; see
.B ContCoverPage
and
.IR mkcover (${MANNUM1_8}).
.TP
.B ContCoverPage\(S1
A template file to use in creating
.IR "continuation cover pages" .
If this parameter is non-null, then the server will pass the
filename to the command specified by
.B ContCoverCmd
to generate cover pages for outbound jobs that are
continued after protocol errors.
These cover pages identify the receiver and indicate 
that the document is a continued transmission.
If this parameter is not specified or is null, then the server
will not generate continuation cover pages.
The specified pathname must be relative to the top of the fax server's
spooling area.
.TP
.B CountryCode\(S2
The local country code in which the facsimile modem resides.
As for
.BR AreaCode ,
this value is passed to the dial string rules for use in
formulating canonical phone numbers for dialing (among
other things.)
.TP
.B CountSkippedPages
If a page range has been specified in the job, and pages are being skipped
during the send, this controls if the pages skipped are counted in the pages
counted and totaled.  If skipped pages are to be counted, it will appear as if
the pages were instantly sent in 0:00 with no data.  The tagline counts will be
incremented on skipped pages, and faxq will notify clients via triggers of them
as well.  If the are not to be counted, then tagline page counts will act as if
the pages never existed, and not faxq trigger notifications will be sent.
.TP
.B DeviceMode
The file protection mode that the server should set for the
modem device file.
Note that this value is given in octal.
The default value of 0600 implies that only the
facsimile user (usually 
.IR uucp )
can access the modem.
See also
.IR chmod (2).
.TP
.B DialStringRules\(S2
The pathname of the file that holds the rules for processing
user-specified dial strings; c.f.
.IR dialrules (${MANNUM4_5}).
The specified pathname must be relative to the top of the fax server's
spooling area; e.g.
.BR etc/dialrules .
.TP
.B DistinctiveRings
Modern distinctive ring support on most modems indicates the ring cadence
rather than the older style of ``RING1'', ``RING2'', etc.  To indicate
the ring cadence, 
.B DRingOn
and
.B DRingOff
values are presented by the modem to the
.I faxgetty
process.  The modem indicates the entire cadence between ``RING'' indications
Like this:
.nf

  RING
  DROF=40
  DRON=8
  DROF=4
  DRON=8
  RING

.fi
The corresponding
.B DistinctiveRings
parameter for this ring cadence would be:
.nf

  DistinctiveRings:  F-8-4-8

.fi
where ``F'' tells the
.I faxgetty
process that the ring cadence is for a facsimile (``V'' for voice 
and ``D'' for data), and the other values describe the ring cadence
with leading and ending
.B DRingOff
values ignored.  Multiple ring cadences are indicated by delimiting
them with commas in this fashion:
.nf

  DistinctiveRings:  V-20,F-8-4-8,D-4-2-4-8

.fi
.TP
.B DRingOff
A string that identifies the ``off'' value in any distinctive
ring cadence, for example ``\s-1DROF=\s+1''.
See also
.B DRingOn
and
.BR DistinctiveRings .
.TP
.B DRingOn
A string that identifies the ``on'' value in any distinctive
ring cadence, for example ``\s-1DRON=\s+1''.
See also
.B DRingOff
and
.BR DistinctiveRings .
.TP
.B DynamicConfig
The pathname of the optional program, e.g. ``etc/localid'', that 
makes dynamic configuration changes, i.e., to 
.B LocalIdentifier,
based on device ID and call identification.  The program is passed those
values as the parameters ($1 = device id, $2 = CallID1, $3 = CallID2, $4 = CallID3, ...), 
when answering an incoming call.  The program can then 
perform local processing as desired to send on standard output the 
configuration items to change in a ``parameter:value'' format, i.e.
``LocalIdentifier: +1.800.555.1212''.  If there are multiple parameters
to be changed, then each item must be on its own line.
This is commonly used to dynamically alter the local identification 
of systems which use DID/DNIS, but it can also be used to allow different
modem configurations for different senders.  This program can also set the
.BR RejectCall
options to cause the current call to be rejected instead of answered.
Note that this file must be marked as executable by the faxgetty process.
.TP
.B EGettyArgs
A string that indicates whether or not the server should use an
an external getty application to deduce and possibly handle an incoming call.
If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted
as a set of arguments to pass to the getty program.
Before supplying the arguments, the string is first scanned
for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced
with the tty name and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with
the serial port speed (in decimal).
Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced
by the match to the corresponding
.BR CallIDPattern ,
if present.
The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''.
If the
.B EGettyArgs
parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if
the string value is null, then ``extern'' connections will be rejected.
Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments, the
external getty
program is invoked with its standard input, output, and error
descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.

When the external getty application completes, its exit status is evaluated
and is interpreted to indicate what, if anything, should be done with the call.
An exit status of ``0'' indicates an unknown call type and that the call should
be handled as if the external getty program had not been used.  An exit status
of ``1'' indicates a data connection and that the
.IR getty (${MANNUM1_8})
program should be used to handle the call (see
.BR GettyArgs )
after being answered with
.B ModemAnswerDataBeginCmd .
An exit status of ``2'' indicates a fax connection that should be handled after
being answered with
.BR ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd .
An exit status of ``3'' indicates a voice call and that the
.I vgetty
program should be used to handle the call (see
.BR VGettyArgs )
after being answered with
BR ModemAnswerVoiceBeginCmd .
An exit status of ``4'' is considered to be an error condition.  The session
will be terminated.  An exit status of ``5'' is used to indicate that the
external getty program handled the call entirely, is not an error condition, and
that the session is to be considered terminated.
.TP
.B FAXNumber
The phone number associated with the facsimile modem.
This string is used to generate the
Transmitter Subscriber Identification (\c
.SM TSI\c
) and Caller Subscriber Identification (\c
.SM CSI\c
) information passed to remote machines\(emunless the
.B LocalIdentifier
parameter is explicitly set.
The
.B FAXNumber
is also used to name the session log file where information
for incoming phone calls is recorded; see
.IR hylafax-log (${MANNUM4_5}).
If this phone number is not a fully qualified number
the values of
.B AreaCode
and
.B CountryCode
are used to generate the transmitted
.SM CSI
and
.SM TSI.
.TP
.B Include\(S2
Include the specified file and parse it as a config file
.TP
.B InternationalPrefix\(S2
The string to use to place an international phone call.
In the United States, this is ``011''.
This string is passed to the dial string rules.
.TP
.B JobControlCmd\(S1
The command to invoke to which provides Job Control information for a
job. See
.IR JobControl (${MANNUM1_8}).
.TP
.B JobReqBusy
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job whose
dialing attempt failed with a ``\s-1BUSY\s+1'' status result.
.TP
.B JobReqDataConn
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a facsimile job whose
dialing attempt failed because a data modem answered the phone.
.TP
.B JobReqNoAnswer
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job whose
dialing attempt failed with a ``\s-1NO ANSWER\s+1'' status result.
.TP
.B JobReqNoCarrier
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job whose
dialing attempt failed with a ``\s-1NO CARRIER\s+1'' status result.
.TP
.B JobReqNoFCon
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a facsimile job whose
dialing attempt failed because the initial facsimile protocol
handshake failed (i.e. no ``\s-1+FCON:\s+1'' result was received
from a Class 2/2.0 modem).
.TP
.B JobReqOther\(S2
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a job that
failed for a reason not already covered by one of the
.B JobReq*
parameters.
.TP
.B JobReqProto
The delay in seconds to wait before retrying a facsimile job that
failed because of a fax protocol error.
.TP
.B JobRetryBusy
The number of times to redial a phone number after receiving
a ``\s-1BUSY\s+1'' result code when the number has not
been successfully dialed before.
.TP
.B JobRetryDataConn
The number of times to redial a phone number after the
dialing attempt failed because a data modem answered the phone when
the number has not been successfully dialed before.
.TP
.B JobRetryNoAnswer
The number of times to redial a phone number after the
dialing attempt failed because of NO ANSWER when
the number has not been successfully dialed before.
.TP
.B JobRetryNoCarrier
The number of times to redial a phone number after the
dialing attempt failed because of NO CARRIER when
the number has not been successfully dialed before.
In normal operation the fax server will treat this result code
to mean that a facsimile modem/machine did not answer the
phone and reject the transmit job.
This is done to avoid repeatedly dialing wrong phone numbers
and depends on the modem distinguishing between
no carrier and no answer.
However, some modems are not capable of reliably
distinguishing between no carrier and no answer, or when instructed
to do so do not identify a busy signal correctly.
For these modems one may find it necessary to increase the
value of this parameter to compensate.
It is strongly recommended, however, that this value
not be set to a large number.
.TP
.B JobRetryOther
The number of times to redial a phone number after the
dialing attempt failed for a reason not already covered
by one of the other JobRetry* parameters when
the number has not been successfully dialed before.
.TP
.B GettyArgs
A string that indicates whether or not the server should invoke
the
.IR getty (${MANNUM1_8})
program in response to an incoming call from a data modem.
If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted
as a set of arguments to pass to the getty program.
Before supplying the arguments, the string is first scanned
for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced
with the tty name and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with
the serial port speed (in decimal).
Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced
by the match to the corresponding
.BR CallIDPattern ,
if present.
The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''.
If the
.B GettyArgs
parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if
the string value is null, then data connections will be rejected.
Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments, the
.I getty
program is invoked with its standard input, output, and error
descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.
.TP
.B LocalIdentifier
The local station identification string to use when transmitting
.SM TSI
and
.SM CSI
strings (see 
.B FAXNumber
above).
NB: while this string may contain any printable 
.SM ASCII
characters; beware that
.SM "CCITT T.30"
specifies a restricted character set and some fax modems and machines
may reject or not display  non-conforming strings.
If the local identifier is not specified, a canonical form of the
.B FAXNumber
is used instead.
.TP
.B LockDataCalls
Hold the
.SM UUCP
lockfile during the time an inbound data call is processed by the
external getty program.
If this is disabled then the lockfile will be removed just before
the getty program is invoked.
Note however that doing this introduces a race condition whereby
an outbound program may sneak in and take control of the modem
after the inbound call has been accepted, but before the getty
program has started up and installed it's own lockfile.
.TP
.B LockVoiceCalls
Hold the
.SM UUCP
lockfile during the time an inbound data call is processed by the
external voice getty program.
If this is disabled then the lockfile will be removed just before
the voice getty program is invoked.
Note however that doing this introduces a race condition whereby
an outbound program may sneak in and take control of the modem
after the inbound call has been accepted, but before the voice getty
program has started up and installed it's own lockfile.
.TP
.B LogFacility\(S2
The symbolic name for the 
.IR syslog (3)
facility to use when logging error messages and
informational/debugging messages requested through the
.B ServerTracing
parameter.
The list of facility names is standardized; it can be found 
in the system include file
.BR <syslog.h> ;
comparisons are case-insensitive.
.TP
.B LogCalls
Log all incoming calls into xferfaxlog as CALL records.  This allows
a quick check of all incoming calls, regardless of fax completion or
not in a unified manner with other fax logs.
.TP
.B LogFileMode
The file protection mode that should be used when
creating files to hold session logs.
Note that this value is given in octal.
The default value of 0600 implies that the log files are not
generally accessible, which is important if sensitive information
such as calling card access codes are logged.
If log files are to be publicly accessible, this
value may be set, for example, to 0644.
See also
.IR chmod (2).
.TP
.B LongDistancePrefix\(S2
The string to use to place a long distance phone call.
In the United States, this is ``1''.
.TP
.B MaxConcurrentCalls\(S1
The default value to use for the maximum number of jobs for the
same destination that are processed concurrently.
Thus this parameter defines the maximum number of concurrent phone calls
to the same destination.
Unless all of your fax destinations have multiple fax lines 
using the same fax number per destination then 
.B MaxConcurrentCalls 
is probably best left as the default of 1 and exceptions should 
be accommodated by the
.B JobControl 
mechanism.
.TP
.B MaxBatchJobs\(S1
The maximum number of jobs to batch together in a single call.
.TP
.B MaxConsecutiveBadLines
The maximum number of consecutive erroneous rows of image data that
the server will receive before it deems a page to have unacceptable
copy quality.
Setting this parameter to zero causes the server to not check
the quality of received facsimile.
Facsimile received with error-correction do not have copy quality
checking performed.
See also
.BR PercentGoodLines .
.TP
.B MaxDials\(S1
The default value for the maximum number of times the server will
place a call for an outbound job.
This value may be overridden by rules in the
.B JobControl
mechanism.
See also
.BR MaxTries .
.TP
.B MaxRecvPages
The maximum number of pages the server will accept in a received
facsimile before it aborts the session.
.TP
.B MaxSendPages\(S1
The default value for the maximum number of pages the server will
permit in a transmitted facsimile.
Outbound jobs that exceed this limit are rejected.
This value may be overridden by rules in the
.B JobControl
mechanism.
.TP
.B MaxSetupAttempts
The maximum number of times a \*(Fx server program will attempt
to initialize a modem before considering it ``\fIwedged\fP''.
.TP
.B MaxTries\(S1
The default value for the maximum number of times the server will
attempt to communicate with a remote site.
Note that for a call to be counted against this limit, carrier must
be established;
this is in contrast to the value of
.B MaxDials
which limits the number of calls that will be placed on behalf
of a job.
This value may be overridden by rules in the
.B JobControl
mechanism.
See also
.BR MaxDials .
.TP
.B MinAcceptedLineCount
The minimum number of received scanlines allowed on an ``OK'' page.
The use of this setting prevents confirmation from being sent for
very short pages.
.TP
.B ModemGroup\(S1
Define a logical name for a set of modem devices.
This parameter can be used to define a name that clients can use
to refer to a collection of modems.
The syntax is ``\fI<name>\fP\:\fI<regex>\fP'' where
.I <name>
is the name for the group and 
.I <regex>
is a regular expression that 
.IR faxq (${MANNUM1_8})
matches against known modems.
Thus for example, the default modem to use for a job,
.BR any ,
is defined as ``any:.*''.
This parameter may be specified multiple times to define multiple
modem classes.
Modem classes may overlap.
The actual set of modems in a modem class that are considered
for use may vary based on which modems are believed to be ready for use.
.TP
.B ModemPriority
The scheduling priority to use for a modem.
Priority values are in the range 0 to 255 with lesser values signifying
higher (more desirable) priority.
The \*(Fx scheduler process assigns the highest
priority modem that is ready for use when scheduling an outbound job.

If multiple available modems in a job's selected 
.B ModemGroup 
have the same 
.B ModemPriority
value, then the \*(Fx scheduler assigns jobs to them in 
a round-robin fashion.
.TP
.B NoAnswerVoice
Whether or not to disable the answering of calls indicated as
voice (e.g. by
.B DistinctiveRings
).
.TP
.B NoCarrierRetrys
This is mapped onto \s-1JobRetryNoCarrier\s+1
.TP
.B ModemReadyState
Define the
.I state
transmitted to the \*(Fx scheduler process each time a modem
is made ready by a
.I faxgetty
process.
State is one of: ``R'' (ready for use), ``B'' (busy), or ``D'' (down).
The modem state can be used to control whether or not modems are assigned
to outbound jobs.
A modem's state is initially set to ``R'' (ready).
Modem state can be dynamically changed with the
.IR faxstate (${MANNUM1_8})
program or by setting this configuration parameter with the
.IR faxconfig (${MANNUM1_8})
program.
.TP
.B ModemRingResponse
This can be used
to cause the command defined by
.B ModemRingResponse
to be sent to the modem after hearing at least
.B ModemRingsBeforeResponse
RINGs in order to receive DID-DTMF data, for example.
.TP
.B ModemRingsBeforeResponse
This defines the minimum number of RINGs that must be heard before
.B ModemRingResponse
is first sent to the modem.
.TP
.B NotifyCmd\(S2
The command to invoke to notify a client of a job status change; see
.IR notify (${MANNUM1_8}).
.TP
.B PageChop\(S1
Whether or not to automatically truncate trailing whitespace on
pages of outbound facsimile (when possible).
If page chopping is enabled, then pages with at least
.B PageChopThreshold
trailing whitespace on a page will be transmitted as a ``short page''
if the receiver is capable of accepting variable-length pages.
The possible values are: ``last'' to enable chopping of the last
page of each document, ``all'' to enable chopping of all pages, or
``none'' to disable page chopping.
.TP
.B PageChopThreshold\(S1
The minimum amount of trailing whitespace that must be present
on a page before page chopping will be attempted; see 
.BR PageChop .
Note that this value is specified in inches.
.TP
.B PCL2FaxCmd\(S1
The command to invoke to convert a HP-PCL document submitted
for transmission to
.SM TIFF/F,
suitable for transmission.
.TP
.B PercentGoodLines
The minimum percentage of good rows of image data required 
for a received facsimile page to be deemed to have acceptable
copy quality.
Setting this parameter to zero causes the server to not
check the quality of received facsimile.
Facsimile received with error-correction do not have copy quality
checking performed.
See also
.BR MaxConsecutiveBadLines .
.TP
.B PollLockPokeModem
When polling for the presence/removal of a
.SM UUCP
lockfile, also test to make sure the modem is still reachable.
This is useful for scenarios where the modem is apt to become
disconnected while the modem is idle, such as an external modem
that may lose power, where the administrator wants notification
of this (as a ``wedged'' condition).
.TP
.B PollLockWait
When polling for the presence/removal of a 
.SM UUCP
lockfile, the time (in seconds) to wait between checks.
Lockfile polling occurs to ensure the fax server doesn't collide
with another process using the modem.
.TP
.B PollModemWait
The time (in seconds) to wait between checks
for a modem to become ready for use.
Modem polling occurs when a modem fails to reset cleanly.
.TP
.B PriorityScheduling
Indicates whether the \*(Fx scheduler should utilize available 
priority job scheduling mechanisms to enhance realtime execution, 
particularly with Class 1 configurations on older or slower 
systems.

Currently 
.B PriorityScheduling
is available for IRIX, SVR/4, HP-UX, and POSIX-compliant 
(i.e. Linux) operating systems.  The default value
varies to maintain traditional \*(Fx behavior.  On IRIX, 
SVR/4, and HP-UX systems where the configure script detects one of the
functions schedctl(), priocntl() or rtprio() the default is true.
The only other supported priority mechanism
is POSIX sched_setscheduler(), which is used on Linux, OpenServer and possibly
other systems.  On such systems, as well as on systems where no priority
scheduling mechanism exists, the default is false."
.TP
.B PS2FaxCmd\(S1
The command to invoke to convert a \*(Ps document submitted
for transmission to
.SM TIFF/F,
suitable for transmission;
see
.IR ps2fax (${MANNUM1_8}).
.TP
.B QualifyPWD
A string that specifies whether or not the identity of 
calling facsimile machines should be checked against an access
control list before receiving facsimile.
If 
.B QualifyPWD
is non-null, then only messages from facsimile machines identified
in the file specified by the string (typically \fBetc/passwd\fP)
will be accepted; similar to
.B QualifyTSI.
.TP
.B QualifyTSI
A string that specifies whether or not the identity of 
calling facsimile machines should be checked against an access
control list before receiving facsimile.
If 
.B QualifyTSI
is non-null, then only messages from facsimile machines identified
in the file specified by the string (typically \fBetc/tsi\fP)
will be accepted; see
.IR tsi (${MANNUM4_5}).
If
.B QualifyTSI
is not specified in the configuration file, or the value is
null, then all incoming facsimile messages will be accepted.
.TP
.B RecvDataFormat
The data format (compression scheme) to write received facsimile data
when copy quality checking is performed on the host.
(When copy quality checking is not done by the server, for example when
error correction protocol is used, the received
facsimile data is written exactly as it is received from the modem.)
The format may be one: ``1-D MH'', ``2-D MR'', ``2-D MMR'', or ``adaptive''.
An ``adaptive'' format causes the received data to be written using
the data format negotiated by the sender and receiver.
Note that while 2-D MMR is the most space-efficient data format
the resultant file may not be viewable (certain commonly used programs
do not properly read multi-strip TIFF with 2-D MMR data).
.TP
.B RecvFileMode
The file protection mode that should be used when
creating files to hold incoming facsimile.
Note that this value is given in octal.
The default value of 0600 implies that only the
facsimile user can read received facsimile.
If incoming facsimile are to be publicly accessible, this
value may be set, for example, to 0644.
See also
.IR chmod (2).
.TP
.B RejectCall
If this is set to true, the current call will not be answered, and will
be rejected.  This option has no effect if set in the configuration file,
but when set by the
.BR DynamicConfig
program, controls the current call.  This options supersedes the obsolete
.BR QualifyCID
option.
.TP
.B RingData
A modem status string that identifies that an incoming call is
for data use.
This string should be set when a phone line has been setup with
\fIdistinctive ring\fP service.
See also
.B RingFax
and
.BR RingVoice .
.TP
.B RingExtended
An identifier which matches the initial portion of an extended RING 
message sent by the modem to relay CID and/or DNIS data instead of 
sending it formatted on separate lines.
.TP
.B RingFax
A modem status string that identifies that an incoming call is
for facsimile use.
This string should be set when a phone line has been setup with
\fIdistinctive ring\fP service.
See also
.B RingData
and
.BR RingVoice .
.TP
.B RingsBeforeAnswer
The number of rings to wait before answering the phone.
If this value is set to 0, then the phone will only
be answered in response to an explicit answer command; see
.IR faxanswer (${MANNUM1_8}).
.TP
.B RingTimeout
If a ring is heard and the call is not answered, the time in
ms to wait before reinitializing the modem for the next call.
.TP
.B RingVoice
A modem status string that identifies that an incoming call is
for voice use.
This string should be set when a phone line has been setup with
\fIdistinctive ring\fP service.

.BR RingFax .
.TP
.B RTNHandlingMethod
Specifies how to react to an RTN signal received from the remote:
one of ``\s-1Retransmit\s+1'', ``\s-1Giveup\s+1'',``\s-1Ignore\s+1'',
or ``\s-1Retransmit-Ignore\s+1''.

``\s-1Retransmit\s+1'' assumes that the page is not received successfully.
HylaFAX will make up to two additional attempts to send the page,
decreasing signalling rate and retraining.  If RTN continues,
up to 2 additional calls will be placed.  The downside is that if the remote
always responds with RTN, the page will be sent 9 times and no following
pages will be sent.  Many fax machines will not behave this way, although 
T.30 specification seems clear that this is the intent of the RTN signal.

Many fax machines will interpret RTN as meaning to not send the same data
again.  That is because RTN may indicate problems with flow control,
incorrectly encoded T.4 data, or some incompatibility other than line noise.
Fax machines that interpret RTN this way will disconnect and require a manual
retransmission.  This ``over and out'' behaviour can be activated by the 
``\s-1Giveup\s+1'' value.  The advantage to this behavior is that the same
page of image data will not be sent multiple times, but the downside is that
the following pages will not be sent.

``\s-1Ignore\s+1'' is similar to ``\s-1Giveup\s+1'' in that it makes the
assumption the data cannot be automatically accepted by the receiver.  However,
rather than disconnecting the page of image data is abandoned and processing moves
on to the next.  The remote is left to decide what to do with the unacceptable
page of image data.  The downside to this behavior, is that the remote may or may
not have kept the page, depending on its interpretation of the RTN signal - but
it does allow us to continue on to the next page.

``\s-1Retransmit-Ignore\s+1'' is a combination of ``\s-1Retransmit\s+1'' and
``\s-1Ignore\s+1''.  The page of image data is retransmitted up to two additional
times, but rather than disconnecting after a third RTN signal for the same page, 
processing then continues on to the next page.  This approach is an effort to
satisfy both interpretations of an RTN signal.  It allows the receiver to hopefully
receive a better copy of the image data while not failing to send subsequent pages.
If the receiver saves or prints a copy of pages for which it transmits RTN, then it
could save or print up to three copies of every page.
.TP
.B SaveUnconfirmedPages
Whether or not to save a received facsimile image page if the sender disconnects
without sending the post-page message, without hearing our message confirmation,
without retraining as requested, or otherwise breaks fax protocol following such
pages for which the sender should not have a ``receipt confirmation''.
.TP
.B SendFaxCmd\(S1
The command to use to process outbound facsimile jobs; see

.IP
Server tracing is directed to
.IR syslog (3)
using the \fIfacility\fP specified with the
.B LogFacility

Note that 
.IR syslogd (${MANNUM1_8})
must be configured to capture
.IR facility.info ,
.IR facility.debug ,
.IR facility.warning ,

.I facility.err
messages.
See
.IR hylafax-log (${MANNUM4_5})

.B SessionTracing\(S2
A number that controls the generation of tracing information
by a server while sending or receiving facsimile.
The number is interpreted identically to
.B ServerTracing.
Note that session tracing is placed in log files in the
.B log
subdirectory; see
.IR hylafax-log (${MANNUM4_5})

Note that the speaker is always turned off once carrier is established.
Also beware that some modems support fewer volume settings;
see
.BR ModemSetVolumeCmd .
.TP
.B TagLineCoverNumString

Setting TagLineCoverNumString instructs faxsend to not include the cover pages
in the normal page numbering mechanism.  The page numbers used in the tagline
generation will adjusted to not count the cover pages, and the TagLineCoverNumString value
wil be used instead of a page number on the tagline of the cover page.
.TP
.B TagLineFont
The filename of the font to use in imaging 
.I "tag lines"
across the top of each transmitted page.
Fonts must be stored in the Portable Compiled Font (\c
.SM PCF\c
) format used by the X11 Window System.
Filenames are specified relative to the root of the spooling area;
e.g. etc/lutRS18.pcf.
If no font is specified, if a null filename is specified, or if
the specified font file is not readable, then tag lines will not
be generated.
See also
.BR TagLineFormat .
.TP
.B TagLineFormat
The format string to use when imaging
.I "tag lines"
across the top of each transmitted page.
This string may include escape codes that cause various items
to be interpolated into the imaged tag line.
Any escape code supported by
.IR strftime (3C)
may be used as well as the following server-implemented codes:
.sp .5
.ta \w'\fBEscape\fP    'u

%%n	canonicalized \fBFAXNumber\fP
%%p	current page number of session
%%P	current page number of job
%%r	receiver's name
%%s	sender's name
%%S	subject
%%t	total pages in session
%%T	total pages in job
%%v	destination voice number
%%V	sender's voice number
%%%	``%''
.fi
.sp .5
In addition, the format string may indicate that 
text is to be centered in multiple equal-sized
.I fields
by separating text with ``|'' characters.
For example, ``a|b|c'' would cause the tag line to be broken up into
three equal-sized areas with the strings ``a'', ``b'', and ``c''
centered within each region.
The default tag line format string is ``From %%n|%c|Page %%P of %%T''.
The differences between the %%p or %%P and the %%t or %%T options are noticed
when a fax job is retried after an incomplete attempt and only the previously
unsent pages are then queued in a successive session.

.TP
.B TimeOfDay\(S1
The default time-of-day restrictions to apply to outbound jobs.
Outbound jobs will be processed only during the specified time.
Any jobs submitted outside this time period will be held until
the start of this time.
The syntax for time-of-day restrictions is designed to be compatible

.sp .5
where \fIstart\fP and \fIend\fP are 24-hour times, day names can be either
2- or 3-characters, and a null day or time specification means
any time or day.
White space and other syntactic sugar may be freely inserted between

.B UUCPLockMode\(S2
The file protection mode that should be used when creating
.SM UUCP
lockfiles.
Note that this value is given in octal.
.TP
.B UUCPLockDir\(S2
The pathname of the directory in which
.SM UUCP
lockfiles are to be created.
.TP
.B UUCPLockTimeout\(S2
The time in seconds to wait before removing a \fIstale\fP
.SM UUCP
lockfile (i.e. a lockfile whose owner does not appear to exist).
If this value is set to 0, then the fax server will never
remove a stale lockfile.
.TP
.B UUCPLockType\(S2
A string that specifies the type of
.SM UUCP
lockfile to create.
The string may be one of ``ascii'' or ``binary''
depending on whether the process-ID of the lock owner
is written to the file as an ascii string or as a binary value, respectively.
In addition, two prefixes may be used to control the format of
the lock filename.
If the type string is prefixed with a ``+'', then 
.SM SVR4-\c
style filenames are generated using the major device number of the
tty device and the major and minor device
numbers for the filesystem on which the tty device resides.
If the type string is prefixed with a ``\-'', then any upper
case letters in the device part of the lockfile name are converted
to lower case letters;
for example, ``LCK..ttyA01'' is converted to ``LCK..ttya01''.
This upper-to-lower case conversion is useful for systems such as 
.SM SCO
where the convention is to name devices with upper-case letters, but
create lockfiles with lower-case letters.
.TP
.B VGettyArgs
A string that indicates whether or not the server should invoke
a voice getty program
in response to an incoming voice call.
If the string value is not null, then it is interpreted
as a set of arguments to pass to the \fIvgetty\fP program.
Before supplying the arguments, the string is first scanned
for ``%''-escape sequences: any appearance of ``%l'' is replaced
with the tty name and any appearance of ``%s'' is replaced with
the serial port speed (in decimal).
Any appearance of escaped numbers 1 through 9 (``%1'' through ``%9'') are replaced
by the match to the corresponding
.BR CallIDPattern ,
if present.
The ``%'' character can be specified with ``%%''.
If the
.B VGettyArgs
parameter is not specified in the configuration file or if
the string value is null, then voice connections will be rejected.
Note that in addition to the specified command line arguments, the
.I vgetty
program is invoked with its standard input, output, and error
descriptors directed to the controlling tty device.
.TP
.B WedgedCmd\(S1
The command to invoke when a modem is deemed ``\fIwedged\fP''; see
.IR wedged (${MANNUM1_8}).
.SH "MODEM-ORIENTED CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
This section lists configuration parameters that are specific
to the setup and operation of the modem.
All
.I commands
must be specified exactly as they are to be transmitted to the modem
(note that this is a departure from previous versions of this software
that automatically prepended ``\s-1AT\s+1'' to each line of commands
sent to the modem).
When multi-line commands are required, enclose the commands in
quote marks (``"'') and insert a newline character ``\en'' where
lines should be broken.
An example of a multi-line command string is
``\s-1AT+FCQ=1\enAT+FBADMUL=20\enAT+FBADLIN=10\s+1''.
.PP
Command strings sent to the modem may include command
escapes that force the host to alter the 
.SM DTE-DCE
communication rate, the flow control scheme used between
the host and modem, delay for a period of time, flush input
data, and wait for a specific response from the modem.
The following escape codes are interpreted:
.ne 1i
.sp .5
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'<play:filename>    'u
\fBEscape\fP	\fBEffect\fP
<none>	enable no flow control between \s-1DTE\s+1 and \s-1DCE\s+1
<xon>	enable software flow control between \s-1DTE\s+1 and \s-1DCE\s+1
<rts>	enable hardware flow control between \s-1DTE\s+1 and \s-1DCE\s+1
<2400>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 2400 bps
<4800>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 4800 bps
<9600>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 9600 bps
<19200>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 19200 bps
<38400>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 38400 bps
<57600>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 57600 bps
<76800>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 76800 bps
<115200>	set the \s-1DCE-DTE\s+1 baud rate to 115200 bps
<delay:N>	delay N x 10 ms on the host (0 <= N <= 255)
<flush>	flush any pending input data from the modem
<waitfor:R>	wait for the response R from the modem (see below)
<play:filename>	play the specified audio file (see below)
.fi
.RE
.sp .5
Note that commands to the left of an escape code are
sent to the modem before the associated actions are 
carried out on the host.
This may be important when changing baud rates, as the result code
from a command may be returned at the new baud rate.
Also, beware that not all baud rates are supported by all
systems and modems; the set of baud rates supported by a host is
usually listed in 
.IR stty (1).
.PP
The ``<waitfor:..>'' escape can be used to override the default
behaviour which is to wait for an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' response to a
command sent to the modem.
The possible response codes are:
.ne 1i
.sp .5
.RS
.nf
.ta \w'\s-1NODIALTONE\s+1    'u
\s-1NOTHING\s+1	a null response
\s-1OK\s+1	the default response
\s-1CONNECT\s+1	``\s-1CONNECT...\s+1''
\s-1NOANSWER\s+1	``\s-1NO ANSWER...\s+1''
\s-1NOCARRIER\s+1	``\s-1NO CARRIER...\s+1''
\s-1NODIALTONE\s+1	``\s-1NO DIALTONE...\s+1''
\s-1BUSY\s+1	``\s-1BUSY\s+1''
\s-1OFFHOOK\s+1	``\s-1PHONE OFF-HOOK\s+1''
\s-1RING\s+1	``\s-1RING...\s+1''
\s-1ERROR\s+1	error status from modem
\s-1VCON\s+1	voice connection indicator
\s-1OTHER\s+1	any unrecognized modem response
.fi
.RE
.sp .5
For example ``\s-1ATO\er<waitfor:CONNECT>\s+1'' would send
``\s-1ATO\s+1\er'' to the modem and then wait for a response
with a leading ``\s-1CONNECT\s+1'' in it; and
``\s-1ATS99=2\er<delay:2><flush><waitfor:NOTHING>\s+1'' would send
``\s-1ATS99=2\er\s+1'' to the modem, delay 20 ms, flush any
input from the modem, and then continue (not wait for any response).
.PP
The ``<play:filename>'' escape can be used to play a raw audio file with
a voice modem.   This feature can be used, for example, to play a brief
audio message after picking up the line but before answering.  A
configuration example may be:
.nf

  ModemRingResponse:  "AT+FCLASS=8;H1\enAT+VSM=131\enAT+VLS=1\enAT+VTX\en<waitfor:CONNECT><play:/sounds/enter-extension.raw><waitfor:OK>AT+VTS=[933,,150]"
  ModemAnswerCmd:     "<delay:100>AT+FCLASS=1;A"
  CallIDPattern:      SHIELDED_DTMF
  CallIDAnswerLength: 4

.fi
In this example using an IS-101 voice-compliant modem, a RING indication from
the modem will cause the modem to be placed in voice mode, set ulaw audio
compression, and via the connected phone line play back the etc/play1.raw
audio file, which may say, "After the tone enter a four-digit extension, then
start the fax."  Following the message a tone is played.
.TP
.B ModemAnswerCmd
The command to answer the phone.
If possible, this command should generate a result string that 
identifies whether the incoming call is from a facsimile, voice,
or data modem.
Typically this auto-detection is configured ahead of time; e.g.
for Class 2 modems with the ``\s-1AT+FAA=1\s+1'' command.
.IP
The following table describes how the result codes are interpreted by
the facsimile server.
.nf
.sp .5

.ta
.fi
.sp .5
The ``Default'' column indicates the interpretation made for the
result string in either class 1 or 2 unless explicitly
overridden.
The ``Class 1'' column indicates result strings handled specially
for modems operating in class 1, the
``Class 2'' column indicates special handling for modems
operating in class 2, and the ``Class 2.0'' column indicates
special handling for modems operating in class 2.0.
.I Unknown
entries imply that interpretation is based on the way in which the
call was answered; if answering is done for an explicit call type,
that type is assumed, otherwise a Fax call is presumed.
.TP
.B ModemAnswerDataBeginCmd
The command to send to the modem once a data
connection has been established.
.TP
.B ModemAnswerDataCmd
The command to explicitly answer the phone for a data connection.
This command must generate a result string that 
identifies the incoming call is from a data modem.
If this parameter is not specified or is null, then the value of
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is used instead.
See also
.B AdaptiveAnswer
and
.BR AnswerRotary .
.TP
.B ModemAnswerDialCmd
The command to explicitly answer the phone for a dialed connection.
This command must generate a result string that 
identifies the incoming call is from a facsimile modem.
If this parameter is not specified or is null, then the value of
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is used instead.
.TP
.B ModemAnswerFaxBeginCmd
The command to send to the modem once a facsimile
connection has been established.
.TP
.B ModemAnswerFaxCmd
The command to explicitly answer the phone for a facsimile connection.
This command must generate a result string that 
identifies the incoming call is from a facsimile modem.
If this parameter is not specified or is null, then the value of
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is used instead.
See also
.B AdaptiveAnswer
and
.BR AnswerRotary .
.TP
.B ModemAnswerVoiceBeginCmd
The command to send to the modem once a voice
connection has been established.
.TP
.B ModemAnswerVoiceCmd
The command to explicitly answer the phone for a voice connection.
This command must generate a result string that 
identifies the incoming call is for voice.
If this parameter is not specified or is null, then the value of
.B ModemAnswerCmd
is used instead.
See also
.B AdaptiveAnswer
and
.BR AnswerRotary .
.TP
.B ModemAnswerResponseTimeout
The maximum time, in milliseconds, to wait for a response from
the modem after sending
.BR ModemAnswerCmd .
Note that you may want to shorten this value when using the
server-based adaptive answer strategy; see
.BR AdaptiveAnswer .
.TP
.B ModemATCmdDelay
A delay, in milliseconds, that should be performed before each
``AT'' command string is sent to the modem.
.TP
.B ModemBaudRateDelay
The amount of time, in milliseconds, to pause after setting the
baud rate on the serial line.
This is only needed for hosts and modems (such as USRs) where 
setting the serial line parameters does not take effect immediately.
.TP
.B ModemCommaPauseTimeCmd
The command to set the time,
in seconds, that the modem should pause when encountering
a ``,'' modifier in the dialing string.
.TP
.B ModemDialCmd
The command to place a phone call.
The string is assumed to be suitable for use
as a parameter to the
.IR sprintf (3S)
function; so the ``%'' character should be escaped as ``%%''.
The dial command must include a single ``%s'' where the number
that is to be dialed is to be substituted.
Facilities such as tone or pulse dialing, outgoing prefixes
to route though a \s-1PBX\s+1,
and so on should be included in the
dialing command string.
It is also important that, if possible, a trailing ``@''
symbol should be included so that the modem
returns result codes that distinguish between no answer and no carrier.
Use of the ``@'' permits the server to reduce the probability
that a wrong number is continually redialed.
If the modem does not support this facility, then it may be
necessary to raise the number of retries done when a
``\s-1NO CARRIER\s+1'' result is returned.
.TP
.B ModemDialResponseTimeout
The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for a response from
the modem after sending
This value should be longer than the timeout programmed into the
modem through the
.B ModemWaitTimeCmd
parameter.
This additional server-based timeout is provided to guard against
modems that can ``lock up'' when dialing the telephone.
.TP
.B ModemDoPhaseCDebug
Whether or not to query the modem for responses during image data
transmission.  Normally the modem should not produce any responses
during Phase C data transmission.  However, in some debugging
scenarios (i.e. some Class 2.1 modems may show debugging information)
it may be appropriate to query the modem for responses during
the data transmission.
.TP
.B ModemDTRDropDelay
The time, in milliseconds, to pause between placing
.SM DTR
OFF and 
.SM DTR
ON while resetting a modem.  This value should be at
least equal to the time-value of the analogous S-register,
usually S25.
.TP
.B ModemEchoOffCmd
The command to disable echoing of commands sent to the modem.
.TP
.B ModemFlowControl
The type of flow control to use between
.SM DTE
and \s-1DCE\s+1;
one of ``\s-1NONE\s+1'', ``\s-1XONXOFF\s+1'' and ``\s-1RTSCTS\s+1''.
This value is used to select the string sent to the modem
to initially establish 
.SM DTE-DCE
flow control; one of
.BR ModemNoFlowCmd ,
.BR ModemSoftFlowCmd ,
and
.BR ModemHardFlowCmd .
The current flow control setting is also used to select the
appropriate flow control command to send to the modem when
the software switches to Class 1, 2, or 2.0; see
.BR Class1HFLOCmd ,
.BR Class1NFLOCmd ,
.BR Class1SFLOCmd ,
.BR Class2HFLOCmd ,
.BR Class2NFLOCmd ,
and
.BR Class2SFLOCmd .
.IP
The server supports both software and hardware flow control
for Class 1, Class 2, and Class 2.0 modems.
Whether to use hardware or software flow control depends
on the capabilities of the modem
and the host hardware and operating system.
Communication rates above 9600 baud often require that hardware
flow control be used for reliable
.SM DTE-DCE
communication.
However, beware that many modems only support software
flow control when sending or receiving facsimile.
.IP
Note that modems usually support software flow control even
if they have no explicit AT-command to activate it; in this case
it is switched on when the modem enters fax mode, having
AT+FCLASS=... from \s-1DTE\s+1.
.TP
.B ModemFrameFillOrder
The bit order to expect for received
.SM HDLC
frames and to use when formulating
.SM HDLC
frames to send.
This value may be either
.SM LSB2MSB
when bits are ordered from least-significant-bit to
most-significant-bit (as in the
.SM CCITT
specification) or
.SM MSB2LSB
when bits are ordered in the reverse direction.
.TP
.B ModemHardFlowCmd
The command to setup hardware (\s-1RTS/CTS\s+1)
flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE.
.TP
.B ModemMinSpeed
The minimum acceptable signalling rate for transmitting facsimile
page data.
Possible values are: 2400, 4800, 7200, 9600, 12200, and 14400.
.TP
.B ModemMfrQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get the manufacturer
identification string.
If this parameter is not set, then it is initialized
to ``\s-1AT+FMFR?\s+1'' for Class 2 modems, or
to ``\s-1AT+FMI?\s+1'' for Class 2.0 modems, or
to ``\s-1ATI3\s+1'' for Class 1 modems.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the identification string and no command
is issued to the modem.
.TP
.B ModemModelQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get the model identification string.
If this parameter is not set, then it is initialized to
to ``\s-1AT+FMDL?\s+1'' for Class 2 modems, or
to ``\s-1AT+FMM?\s+1'' for Class 2.0 modems, or
to ``\s-1ATI0\s+1'' for Class 1 modems.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the identification string and no command
is issued to the modem.
.TP
.B ModemNoAutoAnswerCmd
The command to stop the modem from automatically
answering when the phone rings.
.TP
.B ModemNoAutoAnswerCmdDelay
The time, in milliseconds, to pause after receiving the OK following
.B ModemNoAutoAnswerCmd
before any further commands are sent to the modem.  All input from
the modem is flushed after pausing.
.TP
.B ModemNoFlowCmd
The command to disable flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE.
.TP
.B ModemOnHookCmd
The command to place the phone ``on hook''
(i.e. hangup).
.TP
.B ModemPageDoneTimeout
The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for a response
from the modem after sending a page of facsimile data (e.g.
the time to wait for a response to a Class 2/2.0
.SM AT+FET
command).
.TP
.B ModemPageStartTimeout
The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for an initial
response from the modem when sending a page of facsimile data
(e.g. the time to wait for a response to a Class 2/2.0
.SM AT+FDR
command).
.TP
.B ModemRaiseATCommands
Indicates whether or not all configuration AT commands for the modem should
be raised to upper-case automatically.  The standard is for all upper-case
to be used in AT commands, and indeed, some rare modems have been known
to malfunction with lower-case commands.  However, sometimes an administrator
may want to use lower-case commands in a rare condition such as to work
around modem blacklisting of dialed numbers.
.TP
.B ModemRate
The baud rate to use for DCE-DTE communication.
This value may be one of: 115200, 76800, 57600, 38400, 19200, 9600, 4800,
2400, 1200.
The default value is 19200 because many modems lock the
rate at 19200 when sending or receiving facsimile.
Note that not all values are supported by all operating
systems and modems; consult
.IR stty (1)
for the available rates on your system.
.TP
.B ModemReadyCmds
A string of commands to issue to the modem during reception initialization.
This string is sent to the modem
.I after
the standard set of configuration commands required by the fax server.  This
is done, for example, to un-busy a DID line so that calls can come through.
.TP
.B ModemRecvFillOrder
The bit order to expect for received facsimile data.
This value may be either
.SM LSB2MSB
when bits are ordered from least-significant-bit to
most-significant-bit (as in the
.SM CCITT
specification) or
.SM MSB2LSB
when bits are ordered in the reverse direction.
According to the various specifications all modems should return
data in
.SM LSB2MSB
order.
However most Class 2 modems (except maybe only Multitech) use
.SM MSB2LSB
for compatibility with modems that were built with
Rockwell hardware/firmware that included a bug
that was too widespread to correct.
.IP
If this parameter is not set, then it is autodetected and set to
.SM LSB2MSB
for Class 1 and Class 2.0 modems and
.SM MSB2LSB
for non-Multitech Class 2 modems. However this may be wrong for
your modem, so you will have to specify this parameter explicitly.
.TP
.B ModemRecvSuccessCmd
A string of commands to issue to the modem after a successful
receive session before the call is disconnected.
.TP
.B ModemResetCmds
A string of commands to issue to the modem during initialization.
This string is sent to the modem
.I before
the standard set of configuration commands required by the fax server.
Note that these commands \fBshould not include normal
reset commands that are specified through other parameters\fP.
For example, commands to setup flow control,
.SM DCD
handling,
.SM DTR
handling, etc. should be specified through the appropriate
configuration parameters and not through this parameter.
In addition the soft reset command (usually ``\s-1ATZ\s+1'')
should not be included in this string; the servers issue this
command explicitly.
.TP
.B ModemResetDelay
The time, in milliseconds, to pause after setting
.SM DTR
ON, while resetting a modem.
.SM DTR
ON does not respond with ``OK'', so this parameter should 
be long enough to allow the modem time to be ready for 
.B ModemSoftResetCmd
successively.
.TP
.B ModemResultCodesCmd
The command to enable result codes.
.TP
.B ModemRevQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get a firmware revision identification
string.
If this parameter is not set, then it is initialized to
``\s-1AT+FREV?\s+1'' for Class 2 modems, or
to ``\s-1AT+FMR?\s+1'' for Class 2.0 modems.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the identification string and no command
is issued to the modem.
.TP
.B ModemSendBeginCmd
The command to send to the modem upon establishing carrier during
a transmit operation.
This parameter is useful for systems that are incapable of enabling
hardware flow control without 
.SM DCD
asserted.
.TP
.B ModemSendFillOrder
The bit order the modem expects for transmitted facsimile data.
This value may be either
.SM LSB2MSB
or
.SM MSB2LSB
(see also
.B ModemRecvFillOrder
above.)
Virtually all modems expect transmitted facsimile data in
.SM LSB2MSB
bit order.
.TP
.B ModemSetVolumeCmd
The commands to use to set the modem speaker volume levels.
There should be five whitespace-separated commands,
one each for setting the
volume to ``Off'', ``Quiet'', ``Low'', ``Medium'', and ``High'';
the default is ``"\s-1\&ATM0 ATL0M1 ATL1M1 ATL2M1 ATL3M1\s+1"''.
See also
.BR SpeakerVolume .
.TP
.B ModemSetupAACmd
The command to setup
.I "adaptive answer"
support in the modem\-if available.
Adaptive answer is the term used for the ability to
distinguish between calls from facsimile, voice, and
data sources.
Note that this string is the last command issued by the device
drivers during setup, so the command string
may, if necessary, switch to a different
operating mode (e.g. on some Rockwell-based modems it is necessary
to issue the ``\s-1AT+FAA=1\s0'' command in Class 0).
.TP
.B ModemSetupDCDCmd
The command to setup
.SM DCD
handling.
On most systems the facsimile server will enable
the \s-1CLOCAL\s+1 flag on the tty device to which
the modem is connected.
This should insure that the system does not close an open
file descriptor associated with the modem if carrier is dropped.
Thus, for most systems and modems 
.B ModemSetupDCDCmd
should setup
.SM DCD
to reflect carrier.
.TP
.B ModemSetupDTRCmd
The command to setup
.SM DTR
handling so that the modem is reset when the
.SM DTR
signal is lowered by the host.
The facsimile server uses this facility to insure that modems
are not left in a ``locked up'' state.
.TP
.B ModemSoftFlowCmd
The command to setup software (\s-1XON/XOFF\s+1)
flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE.
.TP
.B ModemSoftResetCmd
The command to force a soft reset of the modem.
.TP
.B ModemSoftResetCmdDelay
The time, in milliseconds, to pause after receiving the OK following
.B ModemSoftResetCmd
before any further commands are sent to the modem.
.TP
.B ModemSoftRTFCC
Whether or not to enable software-driven Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion.
RTFCC allows HylaFAX to convert the image compression between MH MR and MMR 
formats regardless of how faxq formatted the image file.
Note that when using RTFCC, the
compression format of the file will be ignored, thus the ``-1'', ``-2'',
and ``-3'' options for sendfax, ps2fax, and others will only influence how the
document is prepared by faxq and will not influence the
actual negotiated session parameters.
.B Class2RTFCC
takes precedence over
.B ModemSoftRTFCC
and if both are enabled, then software-driven RTFCC will not be performed
in favor of the firmware-driven RTFCC.
.TP
.B ModemType
This parameter must be set to one of: ``Class2'', ``Class2.0'',
or ``Class1'';
to indicate that the modem is a Class 2-,
Class 2.0-, or Class 1-style modem, respectively.
If this parameter is not set, then it is autodetected and 
the highest supported fax class is used.
.TP
.B ModemVerboseResultsCmd
The command to enable verbose, as opposed to numeric, result codes.
.TP
.B ModemWaitForConnect
If enabled, the facsimile server will not consider a connection
established when answering an incoming call until a
``\s-1CONNECT\s+1'' status string is received.
This is useful mainly for Rockwell \s-1RC32ACL\s+1-based
modems that send ``\s-1FAX\s+1'' and ``\s-1DATA\s+1'' status
messages before sending ``\s-1CONNECT\s+1''.
.TP
.B ModemWaitTimeCmd
The command to set the
number of seconds to wait for a carrier signal
when placing a call or answering the phone.
.SH "T.30 PROTOCOL CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
The following parameters apply to the implementation of the
.SM "CCITT T.30"
facsimile protocol in the Class 1 device driver.
They should not be changed without full understanding of the
operation of the server.
.TP
.B FaxT1Timer
The value of the
.SM T1
timer in milliseconds.
This timer is used to time out the initial session contact;
i.e. receipt of \s-1DIS/DCS\s+1.
.TP
.B FaxT2Timer
The value of the
.SM T2
timer in milliseconds.
This timer is used to time out receiving responses and commands.
.TP
.B FaxT4Timer
The value of the
.SM T4
timer in milliseconds.
This timer is used to time out the reception of
.SM HDLC
frames and, usually, trigger frame retransmissions.
.SH "CLASS 1 MODEM CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
The following parameters are specific to the configuration
of Class 1-style modems; they should not be changed lightly:
.TP
.B Class1Cmd
The command to set the modem into Class 1 operation.
.TP
.B Class1AdaptRecvCmd
The command used to enable adaptive reception support (usually
``AT+FAR=1'').  This feature is new in T.31, and many modems
will not support it.  This feature may reduce the number of
reception failures due to errors cascading from +FCERROR messages.
.TP
.B Class1ColorJPEGSupport
Whether or not to enable support for T.30-E full-color facsimile
with JPEG compression.  Enabling this automatically enables
.B Class1GreyJPEGSupport.
.TP
.B Class1EnableV34Cmd
The command to enable V.34-fax support with at least the desired
maximum primary channel rate.
.TP
.B Class1ECMSupport
Whether or not to support T.30-A error correction protocol.  Use of
ECM will require 64 kilobytes of free memory per modem in active use.
.TP
.B Class1PersistentECM
Whether or not to continue to retransmit and allow to continue to 
receive image data in ECM protocol 
which is not accepted as valid after four successive attempts.
.TP
.B Class1ECMFrameSize
The size in bytes of image frames to transmit during ECM protocol.
This setting will also indicate a preference in receive sessions.
The only acceptable values are 64 and 256.  A setting of 64 may
be useful on high-load systems and possibly environments with
extremely poor line quality.
.TP
.B Class1ExtendedRes
Whether or not to support resolutions other than normal and fine.
This option has been deprecated by
.B Class1Resolutions.
.TP
.B Class1FrameOverhead
The number of extraneous bytes in
.SM HDLC
frames sent to the host in response to an ``\s-1AT+FRH\s+1'' command.
For modems that properly implement the Class 1 interface, this
number should be 4 (the default).
.TP
.B Class1GreyJPEGSupport
Whether or not to enable support for T.30-E greyscale facsimile
with JPEG compression.  This is always enabled if
.B Class1ColorJPEGSupport
is enabled.
.TP
.B Class1HookSensitivity
The number of times to ignore on-hook detections and merely treat them
as command or modem errors.
.TP
.B Class1JBIGSupport
Whether or not to enable support for T.85 monochrome facsimile
with JBIG compression.  Options are ``true'' for support in both
sending and receiving, ``false'' for no support, ``send'' for 
support only in sending, and ``receive'' for support only in 
receiving.  If, during the build process a compatible JBIG library 
was found then send support is enabled by default.  If, during
the build process the TIFF tools are found to support JBIG then
receive support is enabled by default.
.TP
.B Class1HasRHConnectBug
A Class 1 modem should only report CONNECT after AT+FRH=3 when
V.21 HDLC data is detected.  However, some modems will incorrectly
report CONNECT after AT+FRH=3 whenever any carrier is present. In
such cases
.B Class1HasRHConnectBug
should be set to ``true''.
.TP
.B Class1HFLOCmd
The command to setup hardware (\s-1RTS/CTS\s+1)
flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE
when operating in Class 1.
This command is issued immediately after sending the
.B Class1Cmd
to switch the modem to Class 1 operation.
.TP
.B Class1MRSupport
Whether or not to enable support for two-dimensional Modified Read
(MR) image data format compression.
.TP
.B Class1MMRSupport
Whether or not to enable support for two-dimensional Modified Modified Read
(MMR) image data format compression.  Note that MMR support requires also
ECM support to be enabled.
.TP
.B Class1NFLOCmd
The command to setup no flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE
when operating in Class 1.
This command is issued immediately after sending the
.B Class1Cmd
to switch the modem to Class 1 operation.
.TP
.B Class1PageLengthSupport
The coded value for page lengths supported by the modem.  The only
correct values and meanings are these: ``1'', A4 page length; ``3'', both 
A4 and B4 page length; ``7'', unlimited page length.
.TP
.B Class1PageWidthSupport
The coded value for page widths supported by the modem.  The only
correct values and meanings are these: ``1'', A4 page width; ``3'', both 
A4 and B4 page width; ``7'', all of A4, B4, and A3 page widths.
.TP
.B Class1PPMWaitCmd
The command used to stop and wait before sending the post page message,
except before sending EOP, when
.B Class1EOPWaitCmd
is used instead.  We must ensure that the high-speed carrier has
stopped completely.
According to T.30, Chapter 5, Note 4, this delay should be 75 +/- 20 ms.
.TP
.B Class1ResponseWaitCmd
The command used to stop and wait after sending TCF, before attempting to 
receive a training response from the remote.  Set this to ``AT+FRS=1'' if 
you experience ``DIS/DTC received 3 times'' errors.
.TP
.B Class1Resolutions
A bitmapped (bit-or'd) value indicating the resolutions to be supported during facsimile
operation.  Individual resolutions follow Table 21/T.32 and are defined as follows:
.ne 1i
.sp .5
.ta \w'\fB131072 (0x20)    \fP'u +\w'Modem Communications    'u
.nf
\fBBit	Description\fP
0 (0x00)	R8 x 3.85 l/mm, Normal
1 (0x01)	R8 x 7.7 l/mm, Fine
2 (0x02)	R8 x 15.4 l/mm, Superfine
4 (0x04)	R16 x 15.4 l/mm, Hyperfine
8 (0x08)	200 dpi x 100 l/inch
16 (0x10)	200 dpi x 200 l/inch
32 (0x20)	200 dpi x 400 l/inch
64 (0x40)	300 dpi x 300 l/inch
.sp .5
.fi
Thus, a value of 3 would indicate support for normal, fine, and superfine resolutions.
.TP
.B Class1RMQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get the list of supported reception bit-rates.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the modem response and no command is issued to the modem.
.TP
.B Class1TCFWaitCmd
The command used to stop and wait before sending TCF, similar to
.B Class1PPMWaitCmd.
According to T.30, Chapter 5, Note 3, this delay should be 75 +/- 20 ms.
.TP
.B Class1TMQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get the list of supported transmission bit-rates.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the modem response and no command is issued to the modem.
.TP
.B Class1EOPWaitCmd
The command used to stop and wait before sending the post page message
similar to
.B Class1PPMWaitCmd.
We allow a different setting in the case of EOP, however, because
empirically some machines may need more time.
.TP
.B Class1ModemHasDLEBug
Used to indicate that the modem does not correctly duplicate DLE characters
in the V.21 communication to the DTE.
.TP
.B Class1MsgRecvHackCmd
If receive failures occur due to +FCERROR just prior to image data 
reception, setting
.B Class1MsgRecvHackCmd
to AT+FRS=1 may help.
.TP
.B Class1RecvAbortOK
The time, in milliseconds, to wait for an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' result code
from the modem after aborting an 
.SM HDLC
frame receive (``\s-1AT+FRH=3\s+1'').
If this number is zero, then the modem is assumed to not correctly
implement aborting and instead the driver will wait 200ms,
flush any input, and then send ``\s-1AT\en\s+1'' and wait
100ms for an ``\s-1OK\s+1'' result.
.TP
.B Class1RecvIdentTimer
The time, in milliseconds, to wait for an initial
.SM DCS
when receiving a facsimile.
.SM CCITT
recommendation
.SM T.30
specifies this as the value of the
.SM T1
timer.
However, adaptive answering schemes such as that described
above under the
.B AdaptiveAnswer
parameter may require that this timer be shortened.
.TP
.B Class1RMPersistence
The number of times that an attempt to receive the high-speed data carrier
should be made, resulting in +FCERROR, before the low-speed message carrier
reception is attempted.  Some modems are quick to (perhaps incorrectly)
return +FCERROR, and for those modems a value of 2 or 3 should be used.
For modems that are not quick to return +FCERROR, a value of 1 should be used.
Proper tuning of this can provide a type of "adaptive reception control"
for modems that accurately return +FCERROR without supporting
.B Class1AdaptRecvCmd.
For those modems that support
.B Class1AdaptRecvCmd,
.B Class1RMPersistence
should probably not be set at 1, although +FCERROR should almost never occur
with such modems.
.IP
If the modem does not support the reporting of +FCERROR or adaptive reception
control, then
.B Class1RMPersistence
should probably be set at 0, which causes the timeout looking for the high-speed
data carrier to be shortened, thus increasing the likelihood of recovery from
any dissynchronization. When
.B Class1RMPersistence
is other than 0 it is assumed that the +FCERROR reporting or
.B Class1AdaptRecvCmd
is functional and therefore the timeout looking for the high-speed data carrier
is lengthened.
.TP
.B Class1SwitchingCmd
The command used to ensure that the sending facsimile device has turned
off its modulator (i.e. loss-of-carrier) 
as recommended by T.31: Appendix II.1.
.TP
.B Class1SFLOCmd
The command to setup software (\s-1XON/XOFF\s+1) flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE
when operating in Class 1.
This command is issued immediately after sending the
.B Class1Cmd
to switch the modem to Class 1 operation.
.TP
.B Class1TCFMaxNonZero
The maximum percentage of non-zero data bytes
permitted in an acceptable received
.SM TCF.
Note that this number does not include any leading non-zero data
in the received data.
See also
.BR Class1TCFMinRun .
.TP
.B Class1TCFMinRun
The duration, in milliseconds, of the minimum run of zero data in
an acceptable received
.SM TCF.
This value should be specified according to a 1.5 second
transmission of zero data (i.e. it should be between 0 and 1500).
See also
.B Class1TCFMaxNonZero
and
.BR Class1TCFMinRunECMMod .
.TP
.B Class1TCFMinRunECMMod
The factor by which
.B Class1TCFMinRun
should be modified in the case of an ECM session.  As ECM protocol
allows retransmissions it is commonly faster to accept a lesser-quality
data stream and the subsequent retransmisisons than it is to allow
the communication speed to slow down (where the demodulation may still
not produce an ideal data stream, anyway).
.TP
.B Class1TCFRecvHackCmd
If receive failures occur due to +FCERROR just prior to TCF data
reception, setting
.B Class1TCFRecvHackCmd
to AT+FRS=1 may help.
.TP
.B Class1TCFRecvTimeout
The maximum time to wait, in milliseconds, for the first byte and
again for the entirety of
the Training Check (\c
.SM TCF\c
) message data that is received during the
training phase of the facsimile reception protocol.
.TP
.B Class1TMConnectDelay
The time, in milliseconds, to delay after receiving CONNECT following +FTM
before sending image data.  T.31 8.3.3 requires the modem to respond with
CONNECT before the modulation training pattern.  If transmission begins
before the remote has successfully completed its own modulation training
pattern then data, especially during TCF, could be lost.  Many modems do
not follow T.31 in this regard, and thus the default is zero; however its
use with such modems would likely have a negligible effect.
.TP
.B Class1ValidateV21Frames
Whether or not to use the FCS bits of received V.21 HDLC frames to check
the validity of the frame itself.  Most Class 1 modems perform this
check independently (per T.31 7.4) and do not require this feature to be
enabled.
.SH "CLASS 2 AND 2.0 MODEM CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
The following parameters are specific to the configuration
of Class 2- and Class 2.0-style modems:
.TP
.B Class2Cmd
The command to set the modem into Class 2/2.0 operation.
.TP
.B Class2AbortCmd
The command to use to abort an established session.
After using this command to abort a session,
the fax software will send
.B ModemOnHookCmd
and then reset the modem by dropping
.SM DTR .
.TP
.B Class2APCmd
A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, 
standards.  This command would be used to enable sending and receiving 
SUB, SEP, and PWD frames.
.TP
.B Class2APQueryCmd
A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, 
standards.  This command would be used to query the capabilities of 
sending and receiving SUB, SEP, and PWD frames.
The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any
.B Class2APQueryCmd.
.TP
.B Class2BORCmd
The command to setup the bit order of sent and
received facsimile data.
Usually the command ``\s-1AT+FBOR=0\s+1'' is used
so that data is sent and received in
.I direct
bit order (\s-1LSB2MSB\s+1).
Some modems, such as the Everex 24/96D,
must use reversed bit order for
Phase B and D data exchanges to avoid a bug that results in
garbage data being placed in the padding of
.SM EOL
codes.
The bit order specified by this command must correspond
to the settings of the
.B ModemSendFillOrder
and
.B ModemRecvFillOrder
parameters.
.TP
.B Class2BUGCmd
The command to use to enable or disable the tracing of
.SM HDLC
frames sent and received by the modem.
This tracing information should be returned to the host in ``\s-1+FHR:\s+1''
and ``\s-1+FHT:\s+1'' status strings.
Note that many Class 2 modems do not support this facility, 
which is largely used for diagnostic purposes.
The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any
.B Class2BUGCmd.
.TP
.B Class2CIGCmd
The command used to set a polling identifier.
This string is inserted into the format ``\s-1%s="<id>"\s+1''.
.TP
.B Class2CQCmd
The command to use to set up parameters for copy quality checking.
For example, for an Everex 24/96D modem this parameter might be set to
``\s-1AT+FCQ=1\enAT+FBADMUL=20\enAT+FBADLIN=10\s+1''.
.B Class2CQCmd
should be configured to set-up all available copy quality services
available per
.B Class2CQQueryCmd.
To disable features that are available, configure
.B Class2CQQueryCmd
with a ``!'', and then set
.B Class2CQCmd
accordingly.
.TP
.B Class2CQQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get the copy quality capabilities string.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the capabilities string and no command
is issued to the modem; this can be used together with the
.B Class2CQCmd
to force copy quality checking to be done in the server instead
of in the modem.
See also
.B PercentGoodLines
and
.B MaxConsecutiveBadLines
for parameters used to do server copy quality checking.  If copy quality
checking is configured to be done by the modem then it is not done by the server.
.TP
.B Class2CRCmd
The command to use to enable the reception of facsimile.
.TP
.B Class2DCCCmd
The command used to set modem capabilities.
This string is inserted into the format
``\s-1%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st\s+1''.
.TP
.B Class2DCCQueryCmd
The command to send to the modem to get the Class 2/2.0 capabilities.
If the parameter begins with a ``!'', then the remainder of the
string is taken to be the capabilities string and no command
is issued to the modem.
.TP
.B Class2DDISCmd
The command to set session parameters before dialing.
This string is inserted into the format
``\s-1%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st\s+1''.
Setting this parameter enables support for Class 2 modems that do not
properly implement the ``\s-1AT+FDIS\s+1'' command by
setting up session parameters before dialing the telephone.
.TP
.B Class2DISCmd
The command used to set the current session parameters.
This string is inserted into the format 
``\s-1%s=vr,br,wd,ln,df,ec,bf,st\s+1''.
.TP
.B Class2ECMType
The interpretation of the EC parameter in the modem DCC response varies
between the Class 2, ``2'', and Class 2.0, ``2.0'', specifications.  This
configuration parameter allows the administrator to specify which type to
use.  The corresponding specification type is used by default.
.TP
.B Class2HexNSF
Whether or not to parse the NSF strings reported by the modem 
using hexadecimal values.  By default, they are parsed as hexadecimal values.
.TP
.B Class2HFLOCmd
The command to setup hardware (\s-1RTS/CTS\s+1)
flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE
when operating in Class 2/2.0.
This command is issued immediately after sending the
.B Class2Cmd
to switch the modem to Class 2/2.0 operation.
For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``\s-1AT+FLO=2\s+1''.
.TP
.B Class2JPEGSupport
Whether or not to enable and utilize the JPEG support found in the modem.
.TP
.B Class2LIDCmd
The command used to set the local identifier string.
This string is inserted into the format ``\s-1%s="<id>"\s+1''
.TP
.B Class2MINSPCmd
The command used to set the minimum acceptable speed to be negotiated
for transmitting page data.
This string is inserted into the format ``\s-1%s=<speed>\s+1''
.TP
.B Class2NFLOCmd
The command to setup no flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE
when operating in Class 2/2.0.
This command is issued immediately after sending the
.B Class2Cmd
to switch the modem to Class 2 operation.
For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``\s-1AT+FLO=0\s+1''.
.TP
.B Class2NRCmd
(\fIClass 2.0 only\fP)
The command to setup negotiation message reporting.
For the correct operation of the Class 2.0 driver
this command must enable the reporting of:
receiver parameters, transmitter parameters, and ID strings.
It is not necessary to enable reporting of non-standard frames
for correct operation of the Class 2.0 driver.
.TP
.B Class2PACmd
A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1,
standards.  This command would be used to set up the polling address
string enabled by the 
.BR Class2APCmd .
.TP
.B Class2PHCTOCmd
The command to use to set the Phase C timeout parameter (in seconds).
The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any
.B Class2PHCTOCmd.
.TP
.B Class2PIECmd
(\fIClass 2.0 only\fP)
The command to use to control procedure interrupt handling.
Procedure interrupts should be disabled because
\*(Fx does not provide a mechanism for dispatching procedure interrupts
to an administrator.
.TP
.B Class2PTSCmd
The command to use to set the received page status code.
When copy quality checking is done in the host, this command may be
used to control the post-page response delivered to the sender.
Beware that some modems do not properly implement this command
in which case the server should be configured to not do copy quality
check: see the
.B PercentGoodLines
and
.B MaxConsecutiveBadLines
parameters to understand how to defeat copy quality checking.
.TP
.B Class2PTSQueryCmd
The command to use to query the received page status code.
This command may be used to determine the post-page response returned from 
the receiver.
Beware that some modems do not properly implement this command
in which case this setting should be set to ``none''.
.TP
.B Class2PWCmd
A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, 
standards.  This command would be used to set up the password 
string enabled by the 
.BR Class2APCmd .
.TP
.B Class2RecvDataTrigger
The character to send to the modem to trigger the transmission
of received data from the modem to the host.
This character is specified to be
.SM DC1
(octal 21) in the
draft specification 2388-A and
.SM DC2
(octal 22) in the 2388-B
specification.
Most Class 2 modems accept
.SM DC1
or both
.SM DC1
and
.SM DC2.
Some modems however only accept
.SM DC2.
Note that string parameters may use C-style escape sequences,
so
.SM DC2,
for example, would be specified as ``"\e022"''.
.TP
.B Class2RELCmd
The command to use to enable the delivery of byte-aligned
.SM EOL
codes in received facsimile.
If this parameter is defined, then received facsimile data
will be marked to indicate that
.SM EOL
codes are byte-aligned; otherwise they will be marked as
not (necessarily) having byte-aligned codes.
.TP
.B Class2RTFCC
Whether or not to enable MultiTech's Real-Time Fax Compression Conversion
which is available in later firmware revisions for the MT5634ZBA-V92, 
MT5634ZPX-PCI-V92, and other models.  RTFCC allows HylaFAX to convert the 
image compression between MH MR and MMR formats regardless of how faxq 
formatted the image file.  If RTFCC is available with your firmware, then 
the response to ``AT+FFC=?'' is non-zero.  Note that when using RTFCC, the 
compression format of the file will be ignored, thus the ``-1'', ``-2'', 
and ``-3'' options for sendfax, ps2fax, and others will not influence the 
actual negotiated session parameters.
.TP
.B Class2SACmd
A largely unused option for modems supporting ITU-T.32, Class 2.1, 
standards.  This command would be used to set up the destination 
subaddress string enabled by the 
.BR Class2APCmd .
.TP
.B Class2SendRTC
Whether or not to append an explicit ``Return To Control'' (\s-1RTC\s+1)
signal to the page data when transmitting.
The Class 2 and Class 2.0 specs (i.e. SP-2388-A and TIA/EIA-592) state
that the modem will append
.SM RTC
when it receives the post-page message command from the host; this
parameter is provided in case the modem does not correctly implement
this.
.TP
.B Class2SFLOCmd
The command to setup software (\s-1XON/XOFF\s+1) flow control between
.SM DTE
and
.SM DCE
when operating in Class 2/2.0.
This command is issued immediately after sending the
.B Class2Cmd
to switch the modem to Class 2/2.0 operation.
For Class 2.0 operation the default is ``\s-1AT+FLO=1\s+1''.
.TP
.B Class2SPLCmd
The command to use to enable a polling request.
The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any
.B Class2SPLCmd.
.TP
.B Class2TBCCmd
The command to use to enable stream-mode communication between the
host and modem.
The value ``none'' may be used if the modem does not support any
.B Class2TBCCmd.
.TP
.B Class2UseLineCount
Whether or not to use the line count reported to HylaFAX by the
modem firmware decoder.
.TP
.B Class2UseHex
Whether or not to parse the capabilities strings reported by the modem 
using hexadecimal values.  By default, they are parsed as decimal values.
.TP
.B Class2XmitWaitForXON
Whether or not to wait for an
.SM XON
character from the modem
before sending facsimile data to the modem for transmission.
Note that this is only relevant for modems that conform to the
Class 2 spec (i.e. SP-2388-A).
The Class 2.0 specification states that the host may transmit
data immediately upon receiving
.SM CONNECT
and that no
.SM XON
character will be sent to the host.
.SH "PAGER-RELATED CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS"
.PP
The following parameters are specific to the configuration
and operation of the IXO/TAP and UCP support for sending pager messages
and GSM SM. Parameter not used for UCP are marked with
``(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)''.
.TP
.B PagerSetupCmds
The commands to send to a modem to prepare the modem for a
call to pager service provider.
Typically these commands place direct the modem to communicate
with the service provider at 300 bps using the V.21 protocol.
Per-service provider command strings can be setup in the
info database; see
.IR hylafax-info (${MANNUM4_5}).
.TP
.B PagerMaxMsgLength
The maximum length for a pager text message.
Messages longer than this number are truncated.
Per-service provider message lengths can be setup in the
info database; see
.IR hylafax-info (${MANNUM4_5}).
.TP 
.B IXOService
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The service identification string transmitted as part of the
.SM IXO/TAP
protocol.
.TP 
.B IXODeviceID
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The terminal device identification string transmitted as part of the
.SM IXO/TAP
protocol.
.TP 
.B IXOMaxUnknown
The maximum number of unrecognized messages that will be accepted
at various stages of the
.SM IXO/TAP
protocol before the sender will abort and hangup the phone.
.TP 
.B IXOIDProbe
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The time, in seconds, between sending a ``\er'' during the
initial ID recognition sequence of the
.SM IXO/TAP
protocol.
.TP 
.B IXOIDTimeout
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for the initial ID response from
the service provider.
.TP 
.B IXOLoginRetries
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The maximum number of attempts to login to a service provider.
.TP 
.B IXOLoginTimeout
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The maximum time, in seconds, to wait to complete the login procedure.
.TP 
.B IXOGATimeout
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for a Go-Ahead message from the service
provider.
.TP 
.B IXOXmitRetries
The maximum number of times to try sending a text message block
in a single call.
.TP 
.B IXOXmitTimeout
The maximum time, in seconds, to try transmitting a text message block.
.TP 
.B IXOAckTimeout
(\fIIXO/TAP only\fP)
integer	\s-130\s+1	IXO: max time to wait for msg block ack (secs)
The maximum time, in seconds, to wait for an acknowledgement
to a transmitted message.
.SH "PROTOTYPE CONFIGURATION FILES"
Per-modem configuration files are typically derived from
prototype files that have been created for known modems.
These prototype files are kept in the
.B config
subdirectory and, by convention, have names
that identify a brand or type of modem and the
.SM DTE-DCE
flow control scheme the prototype files configures.
The
.IR faxaddmodem (${MANNUM1_8})
program that is used to configure a modem for use with
\*(Fx selects a prototype configuration file using information
retrieved from the modem and comments embedded in the prototype files.
For Class 1 modems the product ID code returned by the command
``\s-1ATI0\s+1''
and the response from the command
``\s-1ATI3\s+1''
are used to select a prototype configuration file, while for Class 2
modems the manufacturer and model as returned by
``\s-1AT+FMFR?\s+1'' and ``\s-1AT+FMDL?\s+1'', respectively, are
used (or ``\s-1AT+FMI?\s+1'' and ``\s-1AT+FMM?\s+1'' for
Class 2.0 modems).
.PP
A Class 1 prototype configuration file is identified for use by
.I faxaddmodem
by searching for a comment of the form:
.nf
.sp .5
\fC# CONFIG:CLASS1:144:.*:RTSCTS: Manufacturer='AT&T' Model=Dataport\fR
.sp .5
.fi
In this example ``144'' is the product ID code for an \s-1AT&T\s+1 DataPort
modem, ``.*'' is a regular expression matched against the result string
returned by the ``\s-1ATI3\s+1'' command,
and ``\s-1RTSCTS\s+1'' indicates the modem is configured to
use hardware flow control during fax operation.
The remainder of the line is evaluated by the
.IR sh (1)
and used to specify the modem's manufacturer and model (since Class 1
modems do not have standard commands to query this information).
.PP
Class 2 and 2.0 prototype configuration files match the string
``\fImanufacturer\fP-\fImodel\fP-\fIflowcontrol\fP'' against a
.IR sh (1)
glob pattern specified in the configuration file, where
.I manufacturer
and
.I model
are the strings returned by querying the modem and
.I flowcontrol
is either ``\s-1RTSCTS\s+1'' for hardware flow control or
``\s-1XONXOFF\s+1'' for software flow control.
For example:
.sp .5
\fC# CONFIG: CLASS2: ZyXEL*-RTSCTS\fP
.br
\fC# CONFIG: CLASS2.0: USRobotics*-XONXOFF\fP
.sp .5
are configuration comments that appear in the prototype file for
a \s-1ZyXEL 1496E\s+1 with Class 2 support, and for a US Robotics Courier
modem with Class 2.0 firmware.
.PP
The
.I faxaddmodem
program merges server-specific configuration parameters
into a prototype configuration according to comments
placed in the prototype file.
All lines between ``\s-1BEGIN-SERVER\s+1'' and ``\s-1END-SERVER\s+1''
comments are placed with the appropriate server configuration
parameters.
Note that this means modem-related configuration parameters
must be placed outside this area of the file.
