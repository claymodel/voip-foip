.TH FAXQCLEAN ${MANNUM1_8} "March 14, 1996"
.SH NAME
faxqclean \- \*(Fx queue cleaner process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ${SBIN}/faxqclean
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I faxqclean
is a program that processes completed \*(Fx
jobs and expunges unreferenced document files.
This program is intended to be invoked by
.IR cron (${MANNUM1_8})
on behalf of the super user (i.e. root) one or more times a day.
For example, the following crontab entry might be setup for root to run
.I faxqclean
each hour.
.sp .5
.nf
.ti +.2i
\s-1\fC0   *    *    *    *   ${SBIN}/faxqclean\fP\s+1
.fi
.PP
When
.I faxqclean
is run it scans the
.B doneq
subdirectory in the \*(Fx spooling area and process each job
according to the
.B doneop
field specified in the job description file; c.f.
.IR sendq (${MANNUM4_5}).
Jobs that are marked for removal are purged and references to documents
are removed.
Jobs that are marked for archival may be archived depending on the
options supplied on the command line.
.PP
After scanning for completed jobs
.I faxqclean
scans the
.B docq
subdirectory and builds up a table of document files.
Files that are not referenced by any job and that are older than
a specified threshold are removed.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 10
.B \-a
Enable job archiving support.
.TP 10
.B \-A
This option forces archiving even if 'doneop' in
the queue file is not 'archive', i.e. even if the user submitted the job
without specifying the -A flag to sendfax
.TP 10
.BI \-j " secs"
Set the job age threshold (in seconds)
that controls how long jobs may reside in the
.B doneq
directory before being processed.
By default this value is 15 minutes (15*60 = 900 seconds).
.TP 10
.BI \-d " secs"
Set the document age threshold (in seconds)
that controls how long unreferenced files may reside in the
.B docq
directory before being removed.
By default this value is 1 hour (60*60 = 3600 seconds).
.TP 10
.B \-n
Do not carry out any work; just show what would be done.
This option is useful together with the
.B \-t
option for debugging.
.TP 10
.BI \-q " dir"
The specified directory is treated as the spooling area.
The default spooling area,
.IR ${SPOOL} ,
is defined at the time the software is built.
.TP 10
.B \-t
Trace in great detail exactly what
.I faxqclean
is doing.
Messages are sent to the standard output.
.TP 10
.B \-v
Print messages on the standard output about jobs removed or
archived and about document files removed.
