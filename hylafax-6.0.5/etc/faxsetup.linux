    # We're probably creating a user with the same uid as another,

    # useradds copy a number of "dot" files when creating the home
    # directory, so if available, '-M' prevents that, and if it is
    # an invalid option, then simply not using '-m' will usually 
    # do the trick.  We have to watch the exit status of this script,
    # so, the last command run should have somthing to do with the valid
    # creation of the "fax" user.
