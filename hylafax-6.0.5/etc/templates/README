These templates are used for the default HylaFAX faxrcvd, pollrcvd, and
notify mechanisms.

These templates *will* be overridden by HylaFAX on any future updates
to include new features and translations as they are made.

If you are interested in customizing the templates, it's strongly
recommended that you copy one of the stock template directories, and
modify the templates within it.  This way any future changes HylaFAX
makes to the templates won't interfere with your local customizations.

HylaFAX defaults to the templates in the en/ subdirectory, as documented
in the faxrcvd man page.

The templates have access to all the fax/job information, like:
	$SENDER

Templates also have the ability to include other files, like:
	#INCLUDE corporate-header
This would include the file corporate-header (also including all normal
$VARIABLE substitution) at the specified line.  The #INCLUDE *is* case
sensitive, and must be at the very beginning of the line.

For more information, see the Handbook in the Documentation section of
www.hylafax.org.
