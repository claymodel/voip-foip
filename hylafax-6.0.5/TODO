BH job group support is broken
B  file write errors during receive are not processed correctly
B  polling bug in Class 1 driver (reset FCF sndr/rcvr bit at start of Phase B)
B  no timeout in Class 1 receive if data is received when waiting for OK
   after transmit of TSI (happens easily if wrong receive baud rate setup)
B  sloppy processing of +FHNG: response to AT+FDT (extra read+timeout)
H  faxadduser program equivalent of SITE ADDUSER command
H  job archival support in faxqclean
H  revamp modem status to have a fixed format and include useful info
   like type, manufacturer, etc.
H  fill-in VRFY op to support least-cost routing over a WAN
H  use T.30 subaddress routing for received facsimile (needs database)
H  polled transmission of documents (use SEP and PWD; add registration
   tools and query status support)
H  use PWD in TSI qualification
H  select modems based on criteria such as destination phone number
   (for locations where some lines are capable of long distance calls
   while others are not)
H  voice support integration
H  VOICE/ANSWER button support for ZyXEL
H  silent answer support?
M  optionally replace info directory with a hashed database file to
   reduce overhead on busy systems
M  batch multiple jobs to the same destination (important for pages)
M  bound transmit page count on a per-user basis
M  add type of call control for CID access control list?
M  restructure modem classes to support multi-class modems (e.g. class 1+2)
M  add faxq lock to avoid naive users starting multiple queuers
BL race in queuer/Dispatcher collecting child process status (hack sleep
   in child to give parent time to install SIGCLD handler for now)
BL aborted receives get an extra page written (use TIFFUnlinkDirectory)
L  change receive timeout to be based on seeing EOL code
L  faxmove program, analogous to lpmove
L  permit call type deduction logic used when answering an inbound call to
   be user-configurable (useful for distinctive ring)--not so important now
   with configurable distinctive ring support builtin
O  DataPort<->MicroPorte wedges when retraining after EOM
X  add TOD control to TSI+CID access control lists? (no, can do this with
   cron job that sends FIFO messages to change control list files)

Since v4.0pl2 there is a new style for the collection of the
bug and problem reports. If you want to hunt for bugs you may also
fetch the article from the mailing-lists using the information
from the "refs:" field. Please use the "report#:" if you have
comments or hints to fix the problem.

       problem: MCF/RTN bug in the Class 2/2.0 driver
                the modem says "+FPTS: 2,2219,0,0" which means
                the page isn't good, ends phase C and ends phase C
                and reports "+FET: 2"; HylaFAX just ignores the PPR value

BH     report#: 0004
       problem: Bug in faxqclean
                the TIFF version of the document has a ";31" or ";71"
                or some such appended to it, NOT the "q file" number.
                The faxqclean program looks at these files,
                thinks the "q file" number is 0, and removes the
                file since the "q file" does not exist.
