HylaFAX 4.3.10

OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
HylaFAX 4.3 introduces several new features for HylaFAX:

* E-Mail templates for faxrcvd/pollrcvd/notify
* JobControl for fine-grained job control (obsoletes DestControls)
* Generic CallID framework allows for handling of any identifications your
  line/modem combination can present (obsoletes CIDName/CIDNumber)


Upgrading to 4.3 from Previous releases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release contains important fixes to the faxq job scheduler.
All users should upgrade.

Anyone presently running a version of HylaFAX older than 4.3.0 and
using DestControls should study the JobControl feature we added in
4.3.0 carefully and test migration to the new framework before
upgrading a production server. Likewise, those using QualifyCID to
reject faxes from certain callers should become familar with
DynamicConfig and RejectCall.

* HylaFAX no longer uses the bin/dictionary script and etc/FaxDictionary
  file to customize emails. Users requiring customized emails should
  create etc/templates/some-directory/, copy the basic *.txt templates
  into there, set the $TEMPLATE variable in etc/FaxDispatch and
  etc/FaxNotify and start hacking.
* QualifyCID is obsolete, having been replaced by DynamicConfig in 4.3.0
* DestControls is obsolete, having been replaced by JobControl in 4.3.0
* Some modem config files generated from earlier versions' config file
  prototypes may contain Class1TCFRecvHack.  This is no longer desireable
  for production use, and this feature should now only be used for
  debugging purposes.
* If upgrading from any release older than 4.2.2, be advised
  that CIDName/CIDNumber are now part of a larger CallID framework.
* libtiff-3.6.1 is fatally flawed when dealing with Group 3 images.
  Don't use it as-is.
