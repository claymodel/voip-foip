HylaFAX 6.0.5

Overview
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  HylaFAX 6.0 introduces several new features for HylaFAX:

  There are many additional features available:
  * PCL Support
  * hfaxd Can sort list output arbitrarily for clients
  * I18n: HylaFAX client strings are now translated and available in
    different languages
  * IPv6 support
  * New permissions in hfaxd to allow for more admin control on who can
    see/modify jobs/faxes (see PublicJobQ/JobProtection/PublicRecvQ)
  * Powerful page range handling capabilities
  * Better faxq/notify integration
  * Numerous fax modem/protocol fixes and enhancements

  In addition, the aging support for the unused "old protocol" has been
  removed.


Upgrade to 6.0 from previous 4.4 releases
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  There are 3 differences to note during the upgrade process, probably
  none of which affect most people.

  HylaFAX now supports IPv6.  This means that the default bind for hfaxd
  may change depending on what your system defaults are configured as.
  Some systems (such as FreeBSD 6/7) come configured with IPv6 as the
  system default, but set to not allow IPv4 connections.  On systems such
  as these, you may need specify a bind address with -l if you want to
  over-ride the system default:
      hfaxd -l 0.0.0.0 -i hylafax
      hfaxd -l 0.0.0.0 -i hylafax -l ::0 -i hylafax

  If you have clients that still use the old protocol (not the common
  FTP style protocol), they will no longer work with a new hfaxd daemon.

  The notification email machanism no longer sends "blocked" emails by
  default, as the jobs re not being requeued, or done.  To continue
  receiving them, you'll need to configure it in FaxNotify.
