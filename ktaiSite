Web Application for Japanese Mobile (K-TAI)
CakePHP is a development framework for PHP that borrows many ideas from Ruby on Rails.
Ruby On Rails is more then 10 times faster then CakePHP.
But I am now using PHP, check out Ktai Library for CakePHP1.2.(http://blog.ecworks.jp/ktai).

????If you wish to use Ruby please look at this http://wiki.merbivore.com/start

The features of this library include:

* Handset detection by user agent (docomo, SoftBank, KDDI, emobile, iPhone)
* Carrier detection by email
* Cross carrier emoji lookup
* Entire page emoji conversion
* accesskey attribute for links
* Display emoji on PC



I had a quick look through the code, and unfortunately while CakePHP is Object Oriented,
this code is not. This code, like much of the code for Japanese mobiles make extensive use
of a "carrier code" variable. If the library used carrier objects instead, it would be
much cleaner. Additionally, there is a lot of duplicated boilerplate code in the
KtaiHelper and KtaiComponent class that code be removed in Ruby throught the use of the
Forwardable module. Nevertheless, if you are using PHP, you might be able to find
something that helps you.

Cheers!
