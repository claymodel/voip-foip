HowToRunERP5OnDebian
HowTo describing running ERP5 system on Debian and derivatives

Introduction

You might not belive me, but this is really copy&paste how-to to run ERP5 on Debian/sid, Debian/etch, Ubuntu/feisty and Ubuntu/gutsy.
Pre-requirements

What to you need? Quite clean installation of Debian-like system, for which you are ready to have destroyed. Provided packages are totally experimental, they might (and probably will) destroy your system.

Create normal user in that system, it will be called erp5 in this How-To. Give those user shell and password.
Installing required packages

As root we need to install some packages. ERP5-related stuff is packaged and put into apt-repository. So add to /etc/apt/sources.list those:
Debian: etch, Ubuntu: feisty, gutsy

deb http://erp5.niema.pl/packages/debian/etch/i386/ ./
deb http://www.ventis.biz/erp5/etch/i386/ ./

And run apt-get update as root:

apt-get update

Note: You might want to have more than totally basic repository selection. In case of debian add contrib and non-free in case of ubuntu - universe and multiverse.

Now it is time to install packages using apt-get install command.

Note: Those packages are only "base" system of ERP5 - so some dependences aren't resolved automagiaclly - they will be explicitly listed here.

In first run install this set:

apt-get install erp5-cmfactionicons erp5-cmfcalendar erp5-cmfcore \
erp5-cmfdefault erp5-cmfmailin erp5-cmfphoto erp5-cmfreporttool erp5-cmfsetup \
erp5-cmftopic erp5-cmfuid erp5-dcworkflow erp5-extfile erp5-fckeditor erp5-formulator \
erp5-glpk erp5-ihotfix erp5-ldapmultiplugins erp5-ldapuserfolder erp5-localizer \
erp5-photo erp5-pluggableauthservice erp5-pluginregistry erp5-python-reportlab \
erp5-python-reportlab-doc erp5-python2.4-reportlab erp5-timerservice \
erp5-zelenium erp5-zmailin erp5-zope erp5diff \
python-glpk python-memcached python-ply

Note: Those packages aren't digitally signed (and won't be - unless they state will be official, which is not for now).

Now we need some additional packages:

apt-get install python-svn subversion mysql-server

And mysql configuration:

# as root of course
mysql
mysql> CREATE DATABASE erp5;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON erp5.* TO erp5@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;

Creating instance

Login to system as user erp5 (or any other you created before).

Now invoke:

/usr/lib/erp5/bin/mkzopeinstance.py -d /home/erp5/one -u zope:zope
cd ~/one
mkdir Constraint Document PropertySheet

From now our INSTANCE_HOME is /home/erp5/one - replace it if you changed something.

We need to download some of goodies from Nexedi SVN repository. There is script provided to achieve this, download it and edit a little:

cd INSTANCE_HOME/Products
wget --no-check-certificate https://svn.erp5.org/repos/public/erp5/trunk/products/ERP5/utils/svn_update.sh
chmod +x svn_update.sh

Now edit svn_update.sh with your favourite editor:

1. before ZMySQLDDA put ZMySQLDA
2. replace all /var/lib/zope with INSTANCE_HOME
3. set USER and GROUP to erp5

And run it:

./svn_update.sh

Time to configure timerserver. Add lines using cat:

cat >> INSTANCE_HOME/etc/zope.conf

%import timerserver

interval 5


^D (Control + D)

Time to start Zope:

INSTANCE_HOME/bin/zopectl
zopectl> fg

Last log message shall be:

2007-10-11T11:23:01 INFO(0) Zope Ready to handle requests

Now navigate by your web browser to address:

http://server.name:8080/manage_main

User is zope, password is zope.

Now add ERP5 Site, change only:

* ERP5 Database erp5 erp5
* ERP5 Deferred Database erp5 erp5
* CMF Activity Database erp5 erp5

Now it is time to visit ERP5 Community Site to know how to get support. Other interesting is resource ERP5 Handbook.

Problem with installing Business Templates aka tarfile.py issue

You'll need patched tarfile. To have it on your system, and avoid overwriting it after upgrade invoke:

for p in /usr/lib/python*/tarfile.py ; do
dpkg-divert --add --rename --divert $p-broken $p
wget -O $p http://deb4erp5.googlecode.com/files/tarfile.py
done
