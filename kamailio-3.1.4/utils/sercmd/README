Overview
========

sercmd is a unix tool for interfacing with sip-router using ser exported RPCs.
It uses binrpc (a proprietary protocol, designed for minimal packet size and
fast parsing) over a variety of transports (unix stream sockets, unix datagram
 sockets, udp or tcp).
For more details on binrpc see the ctl module documentation
(modules_s/ctl/README).

sercmd can work in command line mode (the RPC or command name is just another
command line parameter) or in interactive mode. The interactive mode supports
history and tab-completion (if sercmd was compiled with libreadline support).

On ser side the ctl module must be loaded.


Usage
=====

	sercmd [options][-s address] [ cmd ]

Options:
    -s address  unix socket name or host name to send the commands on
    -R name     force reply socket name, for the unix datagram socket mode
    -D dir      create the reply socket in the directory <dir> if no reply
                socket is forced (-R) and an unix datagram socket is selected
                as the transport
    -f format   print the result using format. Format is a string containing
                %v at the places where values read from the reply should be
                substituted. To print '%v', escape it using '%': %%v.
    -v          Verbose 
    -V          Version number
    -h          Help message
address:
    [proto:]name[:port]   where proto is one of tcp, udp, unixs, unix or unixd
                          e.g.:  tcp:localhost:2048 , unixs:/tmp/ser_ctl
                          If the protocol is not specified, unixs will be
                          used if name is a filesystem path and udp if not.
                          "unixs" or "unix" stand for unix stream sockets
                          and "unixd" for unix datagram sockets.
cmd:
    method  [arg1 [arg2...]]
arg:
     string or number; to force a number to be interpreted as string 
     prefix it by "s:", e.g. s:1

If no address is specified (no -s), sercmd will use  by default
unixs:/tmp/ser_ctl. This is also the default for the ctl module (if no
 "binrpc" module parameters are present in the config).


Command Types
=============

There are 3 types of commands: "raw" ser RPC, sercmd aliases and sercmd
 builtins.

The "raw" RPC commands work directly with ser with no change on the input or
 the output.
All the RPCs can be seen using sercmd ls.

The aliases are just other easier to remember names for some ser RPCs, which
some time include nicer formatting of the rpc result.
One can see all the defined aliases using: sercmd help|grep alias: .
Example:
 ps is an alias for core.ps with the output formatted in a more readable way.
 sercmd ps is equivalent to sercmd -f"%v\t%v\n" core.ps.
 Without the formatting, the output of sercmd core.ps looks like:

11262
attendant
11268
udp receiver child=0 sock=127.0.0.1:5060
...
 Using sercmd ps (or  sercmd -f"%v\t%v\n" core.ps) the output looks like:

11262	attendant
11268	udp receiver child=0 sock=127.0.0.1:5060
...

The built-in commands can combine several different rpcs.
One can see all the built-in commands using: sercmd help|grep builtin: .


Getting help on a command
=========================

To get the help message associated with a command use 
sercmd help <command_name>.
Example:
$ sercmd help ps
ps is an alias for core.ps with reply formatting: "%v\t%v\n"
$ sercmd help core.ps
Returns the description of running SER processes.


Listing all the commands
========================

To see all the available commands (ser RPCs, aliases and bultins) use
 sercmd help.
To see only the "raw" RPCs, user sercmd ls.
Note: since each module can define its own RPCs, the available RPCs depend
 on the loaded modules.


Examples
========

Using the default socket (requires only loadmodule "ctl" in ser.cfg):

$ sercmd ps
11262	attendant
11268	udp receiver child=0 sock=127.0.0.1:5060
11269	udp receiver child=1 sock=127.0.0.1:5060
11270	udp receiver child=0 sock=192.168.1.101:5060
11271	udp receiver child=1 sock=192.168.1.101:5060
11272	slow timer
11273	timer
11274	ctl handler
11275	tcp receiver child=0
11276	tcp receiver child=1
11277	tcp main process

$ sercmd help  # list all the supported commands
dst_blacklist.add
ctl.who
...

$ sercmd help core.uptime # help for the core.uptime rpc
Returns uptime of SER server.

$ sercmd cfg.cfg_set_int_now debug 5 # turn debug level to 5 (needs cfg)

$ sercmd # enters interactive mode

Using a tcp socket
(assumes modparam("ctl", "binrpc", "tcp:localhost:2048") in ser.cfg)

$ sercmd -s tcp:localhost:2048 core.version
Server: Sip EXpress router (2.1.0-dev23-make (i386/linux))

$ sercmd -s tcp:localhost:2048 SRV _sip._udp.iptel.org
    name: _sip._udp.iptel.org
    type: SRV
    size (bytes): 104
    reference counter: 2
    expires in (s): 67693
    last used (s): 0
    error flags: 0
    rr name: sip.iptel.org
    rr port: 5060
    rr priority: 0
    rr weight: 0
    rr expires in (s): 67693
    rr error flags: 0

sercmd -s tcp:127.0.0.1:2048  # enters interactive mode over tcp

For more examples see utils/sercmd/EXAMPLES
 [http://git.sip-router.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=sip-router;a=blob;f=utils/sercmd/EXAMPLES].


Interactive Mode
================

To enter the interactive mode start sercmd without specifying a command name
 on the command line.
If sercmd was compiled with libreadline support (automatically if
libreadline dev files are installed), the interactive mode will have tab
completion and history support.

Example:

$ sercmd
sercmd 0.1

sercmd> core.s<tab>
core.sctp_info     core.sctp_options  core.shmmem

=============


ctl module: required, implements binrpc on ser side, without it sercmd 
doesn't work.
See modules_s/ctl/README
 [http://git.sip-router.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=sip-router;a=blob;f=modules_s/ctl/README].

cfg_rpc module: allows setting or reading configuration parameters on-the-fly.
For example one could change the tcp connection lifetime to 180s using:
$ sercmd cfg.set_now_int tcp.connection_lifetime 180
