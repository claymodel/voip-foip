Overview

   The module implements all the operations regarding MaX-Forward header field,
   like adding it (if not present) or decrementing and checking the value of
   the existent one.

Functions

maxfwd_process(max_value)

   If no Max-Forward header is present in the received request, a header will
   be added having the original value equal with "max_value". An OK code is
   returned by the function.

   If a Max-Forward header is already present, its value will be decremented.
   If after this operation its value will be positive non-zero, an OK code will
   be returned. Otherwise (for a zero value) an error code will be returned.
   Note that an error code will be also returned if the SIP message couldn't be
   parsed or if the Max-Forward header's body invalid (non numerical string or
   negative numerical value).

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * max_value - Value to be added if there is no Max-Forwards header field
       in the message.

   Example 1. maxfwd_process usage
# initial sanity checks -- messages with
# max_forwards==0, or excessively long requests
if (!maxfwd_process(10)) {
    sl_send_reply(483, "Too many hops");
    drop;
};

maxfwd_at_least(min_value)

   Test is there is enough hops in Max-forward header, i.e. we know how many
   hops is required to reach target. Returns true if Max-Forward header is
   present in the received request and the value is greater than "min_value".

   Meaning of the parameters is as follows:
     * min_value - Min. number of required hops

   Example 2. maxfwd_at_least usage
if (!maxfwd_at_least(3)) {
    sl_send_reply(483, "Too many hops");
    drop;
};
